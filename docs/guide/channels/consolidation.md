# Consolidation

When an event has multiple streams (different providers, qualities, or feeds), Consolidation decides whether those streams merge into a single channel or split into separate ones.

## Default Mode

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Consolidate** | Merge multiple streams for the same event into a single channel with multiple sources. Exception keywords can override this per-stream. |
| **Separate** | Each stream gets its own channel, even if they're for the same event. More channels, no merging. |

In Consolidate mode, [Stream Priority](stream-priority) rules decide which stream is listed first within the merged channel.

## Exception Keywords

Exception keywords let certain streams break out of the default behavior — useful for keeping, say, a 4K or alternate-language feed on its own channel.

![Channels → Consolidation — default mode and the exception keywords table](../../assets/images/channels-consolidation.png)

Each keyword has:

- **Label** — the display name. It's appended to the variant channel's name, resolves the `{exception_keyword}` template variable, and is part of the channel's tvg-id.
- **Match Terms** — comma-separated terms matched against stream names. For a stream matched through its EPG guide (e.g. a linear `ESPN 2` feed), the matched programme's title and subtitle are checked too, so a *ManningCast* keyword with the term `Peyton and Eli` catches `Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli` even though the stream is only named `ESPN 2`. The stream name is checked first.
- **Behavior** — one of three:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Sub-Consolidate** | Group matching streams together on their own channel, separate from the main channel |
| **Separate** | Each matching stream gets its own channel |
| **Ignore** | Matching streams are dropped entirely — no channel |

- **Enabled** — an API-only flag (there's no UI toggle); keywords disabled via the API disappear from the card.

A fresh install ships with eight language keywords seeded (Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese — all Sub-Consolidate), so alternate-language feeds split out of the box. Each seeded keyword is offered **once**: delete or rename one and it stays gone across restarts and upgrades. To get a deleted default back, add it again by hand.

{: .note }
A keyword never fires on a word the event itself is named with: the *Spanish* keyword leaves a `Spanish Grand Prix` stream alone (and *French* a French Open stream), while `En Español` or `(ESP)` on that same event still counts as a language feed.

The Exception Keywords card is only *shown* in Consolidate mode, but stored keywords are checked on every run regardless of mode — a keyword's behavior overrides the global mode per-stream (an **Ignore** keyword drops its streams even in Separate mode).

Keyword placement is **enforced every generation**: if a stream should move between a main channel and its keyword variant (because keywords, stream names, or a matched programme's title changed), it's moved, and the main channel is always kept on the lower channel number than its variants.

## Race Feeds

Race weekends come with many simultaneous views of the same session — a camera on every driver, the pit lane, the driver tracker, live timing, team radio. Teamarr keeps a **Race Feeds** list for each racing league it has a roster for (Formula 1 today), one row per driver and one per feed type, and every row works like an exception keyword scoped to that league:

| Behavior | What happens to a matching stream |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Own channel** | The feed gets its own channel for each session (`Spanish GP - Qualifying - Charles Leclerc`), with the session's guide data. A 4K copy of the same feed joins that channel. |
| **Separate** | Every matching stream gets its own channel. |
| **Ignore** | The stream is dropped. |

Everything starts as **Ignore**, so out of the box no onboard or pit-lane stream reaches any channel — the main broadcast is the only channel per session. Switch on the drivers you follow and each gets a channel per session; leave the rest ignored. "All own channel" and "All ignore" set every driver at once.

The driver names, the forms providers write them in (`Charles Leclerc`, `Leclerc`, `C. Leclerc`, `LEC`) and the feed vocabulary come from the provider roster and refresh with the team cache, so a mid-season substitute appears after their first race. Only the behavior and on/off switch are yours; a refresh never changes them. A driver who leaves the grid keeps their row so your choice survives if they return.

Because the rows are scoped to their league, a driver's surname never affects other sports — `Hamilton` fires on F1 streams and not on the Tiger-Cats.

## Feed Separation

When multiple IPTV providers carry separate home and away broadcast feeds for the same event, Feed Separation detects them and creates distinct channels for each.

### How It Works

1. **Literal token detection** — streams containing terms like "HOME" or "AWAY" are detected before team matching. The token is stripped so it doesn't interfere with team-name parsing.
2. **Team streams** — a stream matched as a team's own channel (the whole stream name is one team, e.g. `MLB | Miami Marlins`) *is* that team's feed: with **Detect Team Names** on, it goes to that team's feed channel instead of the shared one.
3. **Broadcast-market detection** — the stream is matched against the event's actual broadcast listings from the provider (ESPN reports each network's market: national, home, or away). This is how team-branded channels ("Brewers.TV") and regional networks that don't carry the team's name at all ("YES", "Marquee Sports Network") resolve to the right feed. Matching tolerates the usual drift — punctuation, casing, run-together and abbreviated forms. National networks never count as a team feed, a stream matching *both* sides stays a normal channel, and very short names are skipped.
4. **Team-name detection** — if enabled, streams are scanned for team names in a feed context (e.g., "Orioles Feed", "Orioles.TV", "Orioles.US") and matched against the event's home and away teams. A matchup title alone ("Pirates vs Marlins") is a shared feed and never splits.
5. **Channel discrimination** — streams resolved to different teams get separate channels, even for the same event. Unlabeled streams go to their own channel as usual. Each feed channel gets its own tvg-id (`…-feed-<team>`), which is why each carries distinct EPG.

Detection checks the stream **name, tvg-id, and tvg-name** — a stream whose tvg-id is `Brewers.TV` resolves even when its display name says nothing.

### Settings

Feed **identification** always runs — every stream's resolved feed team *and* which side it is (home, away, or unknown) are stored, driving the [Specific Team's Feed and Feed Side stream-priority rules](stream-priority#rule-types) even with the feature off. The master **Feed Separation** toggle gates only the channel *splitting*: whether resolved feeds get their own channels.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Feed Separation** | Off | Master toggle for the feature |
| **Apply To Sports** | *(empty — all sports)* | Restrict splitting to the selected sports — see below |
| **Home Feed Terms** | `HOME` | Comma-separated terms that indicate a home feed |
| **Away Feed Terms** | `AWAY` | Comma-separated terms that indicate an away feed |
| **Detect Team Names** | On | Also match team names in stream names (e.g., "Orioles Feed") |
| **Feed Label Style** | Team Name | How feed channels are labeled — see below |

### Scoping It To Certain Sports

Home and away feeds are a regional-sports-network phenomenon. They're real and
common in baseball, basketball, hockey and football, and they don't exist at
all in racing, combat sports, tennis and golf — those have no home or away
side to broadcast from.

**Apply To Sports** restricts the split to the sports you pick. Leave it empty
and separation applies everywhere, which is how it has always behaved and what
existing setups keep on upgrade. Pick Baseball, say, and MLB events split into
home and away feed channels while every other sport keeps a single shared
channel per event.

The list only ever *narrows* the master toggle — it can't switch separation on
for a sport while the toggle is off. And it changes only the channel splitting:
feed **identification** still runs for every sport, so the Specific Team's Feed
and Feed Side stream-priority rules keep working in sports you left unselected.

The sports offered are the ones your subscribed leagues cover.

### Turning It Off

Turning the master toggle off un-splits on the **next generation run**: the
existing `…-feed-<team>` channels are deleted and their streams re-land on the
event's shared channel in that same pass, freeing the channel numbers the feed
block held. Only events matched by that run are reclaimed — a feed channel for
an event that isn't in today's slate keeps its normal end-of-event deletion
rather than being pulled mid-broadcast.

Removing a sport from **Apply To Sports** un-splits that sport the same way, on
the same schedule — the reclaim isn't limited to the master toggle.

### Label Styles

Controls the label appended to channel names when a feed team is detected (always in the form `(<label> Feed)`):

| Style | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Team Name** | `NYY @ BAL (Orioles Feed)` |
| **Short Name** | `NYY @ BAL (BAL Feed)` |
| **Home/Away** | `NYY @ BAL (Home Feed)` / `(Away Feed)` |

{: .note }
If your channel-name template already places the feed team itself (any feed variable — `{feed_team*}`, `{broadcast_feed*}`, or `{feed_home_away}`), the automatic `(… Feed)` suffix is suppressed — the template wins.

### Example

Given an event "NYY @ BAL" with streams (default Team Name style):

- `MLB: NYY @ BAL HOME` → detected as home feed → channel: `NYY @ BAL (Orioles Feed)`
- `MLB: NYY @ BAL AWAY` → detected as away feed → channel: `NYY @ BAL (Yankees Feed)`
- `MLB: NYY @ BAL` → no feed detected → channel: `NYY @ BAL`

This creates three separate channels, each consolidating their respective streams.
