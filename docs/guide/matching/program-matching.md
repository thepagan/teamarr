## The problem it solves

Teamarr normally matches a stream to an event by reading the **stream name** — `Cubs vs Cardinals` becomes the Cubs–Cardinals game. But a traditional **linear channel** carries many different games across a day under one unchanging name: `Fox Sports 1` airs *Wales vs Ghana* at 1pm, an *MLB* game at 4pm, and *College Baseball* at 8pm — all as "Fox Sports 1". The name tells Teamarr nothing about which game is on.

**EPG program matching** reads the channel's **program guide** instead of its name. The result: **one** linear stream serves **many** event channels — swapping in shortly before each game and out shortly after — while each event channel keeps its own stable identity, generated EPG, and filler.

---

## How it works

1. **Read the guide.** For each opted-in source, Teamarr asks Dispatcharr for the EPG **programs** airing on the source's streams (`GET /api/epg/programs/search/`).
2. **Match program titles, not stream names.** Each program's title + subtitle (`MLB Baseball` + `Cubs at Cardinals`) goes through the *same* team-matching pipeline Teamarr uses for stream names, and is matched to a real event.
   - **Description fallback:** some guides (Sky-style) title a programme by competition only (`Scottish Premiership Football`) with the matchup buried in the description prose. When the title yields a league or sport hint but no team pair, Teamarr checks whether **exactly one** event in the hinted league(s) both airs inside the programme's broadcast window *and* has **both** team names in the description — and binds only then. Zero or multiple candidates (e.g. a multi-game preview blurb) are skipped, never guessed.
3. **Time-share the stream.** A linear stream that airs many programs is attached to each matched event's channel only for a window around that **program's** guide slot (program start − *attach before*, program end + *detach after*), then detached when the window ends. Studio shows and replays are skipped.

### Where the EPG comes from — you don't map it

The program data comes from **Dispatcharr's own EPG sources** — the XMLTV guides you already configured in Dispatcharr. **You do not tell Teamarr which EPG belongs to which source.** Teamarr links each stream to its guide automatically using a precedence cascade (most authoritative first):

| # | Strategy | When it applies |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Channel mapping** | The stream is assigned to a Dispatcharr channel whose EPG is linked (`epg_data_id`). A *curated* mapping — the most trusted, so it wins outright. |
| 2 | **Loopback** | The stream's URL embeds a Dispatcharr channel uuid (a channel re-ingested as a stream) — that channel's EPG link is used. |
| 3 | **Direct tvg_id** | Your M3U stream's `tvg-id` already matches an **active** imported EPG channel id (namespace-aligned setups). |
| 4 | **Name match** | The stream's name matches an **active** imported EPG channel's name exactly after normalization (stripping `HD`/`FHD`/`(US)`, country prefixes like `US:`/`UK:`, etc.). **Strict:** ambiguous names are skipped, so `ESPN` never resolves to `ESPN2`. |
| 5 | **Xtream (XC) provider EPG** | *Opt-in fallback.* For streams the above leave unmatched, when the source's M3U account is an Xtream Codes panel, Teamarr fetches the provider's **own** `xmltv.php` and matches against it. See [Xtream fallback](#xtream-xc-provider-epg-fallback). |

One carve-out: a channel link that points at a *generated* (synthetic per-event) guide doesn't stop the cascade — Teamarr keeps looking for a real linear guide for that stream.

Strategies 3–4 match against your **active** imported EPG sources only (disabled sources and Teamarr's own `_Teamarr` output are excluded). They mean EPG matching works on **raw stream groups** — you do **not** need to pre-build streams into Dispatcharr channels first.

### Xtream (XC) provider EPG fallback

The Dispatcharr-side strategies require a valid stream-to-EPG mapping **inside Dispatcharr**. Many providers' channels — especially **regional sports networks** — have no guide in your imported sources, so they never match.

As a backup, enable **Matching → Provider EPG Backup** (the `/matching` page). When a source's M3U account is an Xtream Codes panel, Teamarr fetches that provider's own EPG (`{server}/xmltv.php`) directly and matches the still-unresolved streams against it. Because the provider's guide is **source-matched** to its own M3U, the stream `tvg-id` *is* the guide channel id — an exact match, no guessing.

- **Off by default** (opt-in). It downloads the provider's guide once per XC account and caches it on disk, re-fetching only when the cache is older than **Cache for (hours)** (default 24). Provider guides change slowly, so a long cache keeps generations fast.
- It only **fills gaps** — your curated Dispatcharr guide always takes priority.
- Provider guides vary in quality; some carry the generic network schedule rather than the live sports override.

### Dispatcharr channels as an EPG source

Normally each source pulls its candidate streams from an **M3U group** — so EPG matching considers *every* stream in that provider group. If you'd rather match only the channel versions you've **already curated in Dispatcharr**, enable **Matching → Dispatcharr as a Stream Source** (the `/matching` page).

When on, Teamarr adds a second, **additive** source that:

- Enumerates the Dispatcharr **channels** you've mapped that carry an active, non-`_Teamarr` EPG link.
- Takes the **streams assigned to each channel** as candidates, tagged with that **channel's own EPG** (strategy 1 — the most authoritative mapping).
- Matches those candidates by **EPG program data only** — not by stream name or single-team fan-out — so a regional/branded stream (e.g. an RSN) is matched to the events its guide actually lists, never inferred from its name.
- Runs them through the same matching → channel-creation → time-window pipeline.

It runs **alongside** your per-source M3U matching (not instead of it); matches are consolidated onto the same event channels by event identity. Teamarr's **own generated channels are excluded** — they're output, not input. Channels whose streams belong to an M3U group that is already an EPG-match-enabled source are also skipped, so nothing is processed twice — if a curated channel never appears via this source, check whether its streams' group is already a source with EPG matching on. The source is managed for you as a hidden system group ("Dispatcharr Channels") that appears in stats but not in the Sources list; created channels use your global/per-league channel-group, profile, and template defaults.

**Scope it to specific groups.** When you enable the toggle, a **Dispatcharr groups to include** picker appears. It lists the Dispatcharr groups that hold channels, with each group's channel count — provider groups you've never curated channels into aren't offered, and Teamarr's own generated channels don't count toward a group's total. Select the channel groups you actually want matched — Teamarr then scans only those, skipping the matching work for everything else (faster generation). Leave it empty to include all groups. Your selection also becomes a **Dispatcharr Group** option in [stream ordering](../channels/stream-priority), so you can prioritize a group's streams within consolidated channels.

### A real-world pattern: curate channels in Dispatcharr, let Teamarr read their EPG

When several providers give the same linear channel different `tvg-id`s (Xtream sources, HDHomeRun, TVEverywhere, EPlusTV…), matching each provider's EPG separately is slow and patchy. A cleaner setup, contributed by a user in [#598](https://github.com/Pharaoh-Labs/teamarr/issues/598):

1. In Dispatcharr, create a channel profile (e.g. **Regional Networks**) and add one channel per station you care about — regional ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX affiliates around the country.
2. Link each channel to the correct EPG entry **once**, in Dispatcharr.
3. Attach the matching streams from every provider to that channel (the `stream-mapparr` plugin does this in bulk). Optional: probe them with a stream checker so Teamarr's stream-stats ordering can rank them by resolution.
4. In Teamarr, enable **Dispatcharr channels as an EPG source** (above). Each curated channel's own EPG now drives the match, and every game on those affiliates lands on its event channel with all providers' streams attached.

This keeps EPG mapping in one place, avoids loading every provider's guide into Teamarr, and makes generation noticeably faster.

## Requirements

- **Dispatcharr with the program-search API** — `GET /api/epg/programs/search/`, **confirmed on Dispatcharr `0.24.0`**. Teamarr probes for the endpoint the first time it builds the program index (and caches the answer); on older builds the feature simply stays off, with no errors.
- **A configured EPG source in Dispatcharr** whose guide covers your linear channels.
- A stream resolvable to that guide by one of strategies 1–4 above — or, with the opt-in Xtream fallback, an XC provider whose own EPG covers it. Streams that resolve to nothing are left to normal name matching.

{: .note }
> EPG matching is **opt-in and off by default** — enabled per source. There is no global on/off switch.

---

## Enabling it

### 1. Per-source switch

On each [Source](../sources/), enable the **EPG matching** toggle (in the editor's Basic Settings; bulk edit and import call it *EPG program matching*). Only sources that opt in are scanned. This is the right switch for sources that contain linear channels (e.g. a "US \| Sports" source of ESPN/FS1/SEC Network feeds).

Enabling it on a source automatically **bypasses built-in stream filtering** for that source, because static linear names (`ESPN`, `NBA1`) have no `vs`/`@` separator and would otherwise be dropped before matching.

The toggle is also available in **bulk edit** (select multiple sources → Edit) and at **bulk import** time, so you can flip a whole batch of linear-channel sources at once.

### 2. Buffers

Two global buffer fields, under **Attach/Detach Timing** on the **Matching** page, set the attach/detach window for every source that opts in:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Attach before (minutes)** | 60 | How long *before* a matched program's start the stream attaches to the event channel. |
| **Detach after (minutes)** | 60 | How long *after* the program's end the stream detaches. |

Buffers give viewers lead-in/lead-out time and absorb schedule slippage. They apply in full — the buffers you set drive the whole window. If a large buffer makes two adjacent programs on the same channel overlap, the stream is simply attached to **both** event channels during the overlap; nothing is trimmed. Buffer changes take effect on the next generation run, including for already-attached streams.

## Seeing what matched

### The EPG badge

Sources with EPG matching enabled show a violet **EPG** badge in the Sources list, alongside the **Stream Name** (sky), **Team** (emerald), and **Regex** (blue) badges.

### Preview

Use **Preview stream matches** on a source to see EPG matches before a real generation run — the preview exercises the same EPG path (it carries the stream `tvg_id` through to the matcher).

### Stream ordering — the "EPG matched stream" type

In **Channels → Stream Priority**, add a **Stream Type** rule and choose **EPG matched stream** to prioritize streams that were attached via EPG matching. Use it to push time-shared linear streams ahead of — or behind — name-matched (event/team) streams within a consolidated channel. See [Channels → Stream Priority](../channels/stream-priority).

{: .note }
> The ordering rule reads a `match_method` tag stored on each attached stream. Streams attached *before* this feature existed carry no tag until they're re-matched on the next generation run, so the rule applies going forward.

## Tennis programmes

Guide entries for tennis are usually tournament-level ("Wimbledon", "WTA 1000 Toronto — Day 3") and one programme covers many concurrent matches, so tennis follows a stricter rule than team sports. A programme binds only when its EPG fields — title, sub-title **or** description, any of them — establish both:

1. a **tournament** that is playing that day, and
2. either a **player pair** ("Sabalenka vs Osaka", or both surnames of one match anywhere in the description) or a **court** ("Centre Court", "Court 5").

A pair binds that one match. A court binds every match on that court that falls inside the programme's broadcast slot. A programme that gives only the tournament (or only players, with no tournament) binds nothing and the stream shows **"Tennis matchup not known"** in Run History — Teamarr never spreads one programme across a whole tournament.

A programme does not need the word "tennis" in its title to take this path: a title that names a tournament in that day's schedule (`US Open 2026 | Men's First Round: Shelton/Griekspoor`) is tried as a tennis programme first, and only falls back to ordinary team-sport matching if it binds nothing.

## Why some channels show red in Dispatcharr

A channel that shows **red** in Dispatcharr means no streams are currently attached to it. With EPG program matching, that is often **completely normal**: time-sharing means the linear stream is attached only inside the window around each matched program — outside it, the stream is intentionally detached so it's free to serve the next event's channel, and the channel goes red.

{: .note }
> **Red ≠ broken.** For an EPG-matched event channel, red simply means you're outside the attach window — the game is hours away, or already over. The stream re-attaches as the program approaches (within *Attach before*) and detaches after *Detach after*. Only a channel that stays red **during** its event window is worth investigating — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-nothing-matched).

---

## Caveats & limits

- **Attach/detach precision is bounded by generation cadence.** A stream can only swap in/out when EPG generation runs (your scheduled cron). With hourly runs, expect roughly hourly granularity — the buffers exist partly to cover this.
- **Replays and studio shows are intentionally skipped.** Programs tagged *Classic Sport Event* (replays) or *Sports non-event* (studio/talk) don't match. A live channel showing offseason replays will legitimately match little or nothing.
- **A matched event must actually exist.** EPG matching pairs a program to a real event in your subscribed leagues. A guide entry for a game in a league you don't follow (or a finished game) won't match.
- **Strict name matching skips ambiguous names** to avoid wrong matches. Some channels may not resolve by name alone and will rely on the channel-mapping or direct-tvg_id strategies.

---

## Troubleshooting: "nothing matched"

Work down this list:

1. **Source opted in?** Enable **EPG matching** on the Source (there is no global switch).
2. **Program-search supported?** It needs a Dispatcharr build with `/api/epg/programs/search/` (0.24.0+). On older builds the feature is silently off.
3. **Do the streams resolve to a guide?** They must match by a linked Dispatcharr channel, direct tvg_id, or an exact normalized name against an **active** imported EPG. Channels with no EPG coverage can't match — unless the provider is Xtream and you enable the **XC provider EPG fallback** (Matching → Provider EPG Backup).
4. **Is anything actually on?** Check the channel's guide — overnight/offseason slots are mostly replays and studio shows, which are skipped by design.
5. **Are the leagues subscribed?** The program's game must map to an event in a league you follow.
6. **Read the failure row.** A linear channel whose guide programmes were attempted but matched nothing is recorded as **"No guide programme matched"** with a summary in its detail — how many programmes were in the window, how many were attempted vs skipped as non-events, and sample titles. That detail (in Run History and support bundles) usually answers which of the questions above applies.
