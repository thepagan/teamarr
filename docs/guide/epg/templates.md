# Templates

Templates define how your EPG content looks - the titles, descriptions, and artwork for programmes in your guide.

**New install?** Teamarr ships with a curated set of
[starter templates](../templates/defaults) modeled on
professional (Gracenote) EPG conventions — you don't need to build templates
from scratch. Assign the starters that match your setup and customize later.

## What Templates Do

When Teamarr generates EPG, it uses templates to create programme entries. Templates contain:

- **Title, subtitle, and description formats** using variables like `{team_name}`, `{opponent}`, `{game_time}`
- **Filler content** for pregame, postgame, and idle periods
- **Conditional logic** to show different descriptions based on game context
- **XMLTV metadata** like categories and flags

A single template can be assigned to multiple teams or event groups.

## Template Types

### Team Templates

For **team-based EPG** where each team has a dedicated channel (e.g., "Detroit Lions", "LA Lakers").

- Channel persists 24/7
- Content shown from the team's perspective ("we play the Bears")
- Includes idle content for days without games
- Supports `.next` and `.last` suffixes to reference upcoming/previous games

### Event Templates

For **event-based EPG** where channels are created dynamically for each game.

- Channels appear around game time and disappear after
- Content is positional ("away team @ home team") rather than team-specific
- No idle content needed (no channel when no game)
- No `.next` or `.last` suffixes needed - each channel references only one event
- Used with event groups that match streams to real events

## Template Form Tabs

The template editor has five tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Basic Info** | Template name and event duration settings |
| **Defaults** | Title, subtitle, description(s), artwork URL, and channel name/logo (event templates) |
| **Conditions** | Rules that show different descriptions based on game context (team templates only) |
| **Fillers** | Pregame, postgame, and idle content, each with optional condition rows |
| **Other EPG Options** | XMLTV categories, tags (new/live/date), and video quality |

When **creating** a template, every tab is pre-filled with working defaults: a **Next** button below each tab walks you through them in order, and each tab in the strip carries a small hint — a check once you've reviewed it, an amber dot if something required (the template name) is still missing. Tabs stay freely clickable, and editing an existing template shows no stepper at all.

The **Previewing as** bar above the tabs selects the league (and live vs. sample data) for every preview on the page, and the **Guide Preview** card in the right rail renders the title, subtitle, and description as a viewer's guide would show them — see [Previewing Templates](variables.md#previewing-templates).

## Variables

Templates use variables enclosed in curly braces that get replaced with real data:

```
{team_name} vs {opponent} at {venue}
→ "Detroit Lions vs Chicago Bears at Ford Field"
```

**Team templates** support suffixes for multi-game context:
- `{opponent}` - current game's opponent
- `{opponent.next}` - next game's opponent
- `{opponent.last}` - last game's opponent

**Event templates** don't use suffixes - each channel exists for a single event, so there's no "next" or "last" game to reference.

See [Variables](variables) for the complete list of 217 available variables. Artwork
fields support a shared [Game Thumbs](game-thumbs) base URL so templates can store
relative image paths — see [Artwork & Game Thumbs](variables#artwork--game-thumbs).

## Filler Content

Team templates support filler programmes for non-game periods:

| Filler | When It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Pregame** | Hours before game starts (configurable) |
| **Postgame** | After game ends until midnight or next programme |
| **Idle** | Days with no games scheduled |

Each filler has its own title, subtitle, description, and artwork URL — plus
optional **condition rows** that override those fields based on the register's
reference game (pregame → next game, postgame/idle → last game). The starter
set uses this to show ESPN's recap headline once it's published and an
in-progress line while a game is still running. See
[Filler condition rows](conditions#filler-condition-rows).

## Conditions

Conditions let you show different descriptions based on game context:

- Team on a win streak? Show "🔥 5-game win streak!"
- Playing at home? Show "Home game at {venue}"
- Ranked matchup? Show "Top 25 showdown"

Conditions have priorities - the first matching condition wins.

See [Conditions](conditions) for available condition types.

## Getting Started

The fastest path is the shipped starter set — every install seeds ten
Gracenote-modeled templates covering team channels, US pro events, soccer
(club and international), college, combat, tennis, and racing.
See [Default Templates](../templates/defaults) for the full
set and recommended scoping.

1. Go to **Templates** — the starter templates are already there, unassigned
2. Assign the ones that match your setup (per sport/league, or as global
   defaults) via **Template Assignments**
3. Rename or edit freely — an edited starter is yours and never touched by
   upgrades

To build your own from scratch:

1. Go to **Templates** and click **Create Template**
2. Choose **Team** or **Event** type (this cannot be changed later)
3. Fill in the defaults with your preferred formats
4. Optionally configure fillers and conditions
5. Save and assign the template to teams or event groups
