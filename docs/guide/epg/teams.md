# Teams

![EPG → Team EPG — settings card, stats, and the teams table](../../assets/images/epg-teams.png)

Team EPG builds one persistent **XMLTV schedule** per active team in the guide Teamarr writes. By default, point one of your existing Dispatcharr channels at the team's XMLTV channel id through Dispatcharr's normal EPG association. This is a manual, guide-only setup: Teamarr does not create or modify that Dispatcharr channel.

Optionally, enable **managed channels** for an individual team. Teamarr then creates and maintains one persistent Dispatcharr channel in the dedicated managed-team range, attaches the team's XMLTV guide, and attaches matching streams from enabled Event Groups only while their game windows are active. The channel remains in place between games, with no streams attached.

## How It Works

1. Import teams from the league cache
2. Assign a **team template** to each team
3. Teamarr looks up each team's schedule and writes EPG programmes for that team's XMLTV channel
4. For managed teams, Teamarr also evaluates streams from enabled Event Groups against the team's scheduled games and reconciles temporary stream memberships on the persistent channel

Each team's EPG includes:
- **Pregame** programmes before the game starts
- **Live event** programmes during the game
- **Postgame** programmes after the game ends
- **Idle** programmes on days with no games

## Importing Teams

Go to **EPG → Team EPG** and click **Add Team** to browse the league cache by sport.

1. Click a sport to expand its leagues
2. Click a league to see available teams
3. Select teams individually or use **Select All**
4. Click **Import Selected Teams**

For NCAA football and basketball, a **conference filter** appears next to the team search — pick a conference (SEC, Big Ten, …) to narrow the list, then **Select All** grabs the whole conference at once. Conference membership comes from ESPN's season-scoped data and refreshes with the team cache, so realignment is picked up automatically. Other college sports have no ESPN conference data, so the filter doesn't appear for them.

Teams are grouped by sport in the sidebar. The badge next to each sport shows how many importable leagues it has; each league shows its cached team count. Leagues with 0 teams haven't had their cache refreshed yet — use the cache refresh on **Settings → Advanced** (Data Caches).

## Managing Teams

The Teams table lists all imported teams. Columns are sortable, and a filter row under the header narrows the list.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Team** | Team name with logo |
| **League** | League the team belongs to |
| **Sport** | The team's sport |
| **Channel ID** | XMLTV channel id — point a Dispatcharr channel at this id to wire up the EPG. Generated as PascalCase team name + league (e.g. `DetroitLions.nfl`) at import; regenerate in bulk with a custom format via the **Channel ID** action after selecting rows |
| **Managed** | Shows whether Teamarr manages a persistent Dispatcharr channel for this team and its channel number (`Auto` until the first generation assigns one). A red badge means the last generation could not create or update the channel — hover it for the reason (a hand-made channel already using the team's `tvg-id`, an occupied number override, a Dispatcharr error) |
| **Template** | Assigned template (click to change) |
| **Status** | On/off toggle — inactive teams are excluded from EPG generation |
| **Actions** | Per-team actions (delete, etc.) |

### Assigning Templates

Each team needs a **team template** assigned — see [Team vs Event](team-vs-event) for how team templates differ. Edit a team (pencil icon) to change its template, or select multiple rows and use **Assign Template** to bulk-assign.

### Managed Channels

The edit dialog can enable a persistent managed channel for a team. Turning it on also activates the team, because Teamarr needs its guide data to manage the channel. Set an optional channel-number override there, or leave it automatic. To switch management on or off for many teams at once, select their rows and use the **Managed Channel** bulk action; numbers are always assigned automatically that way.

Configure the automatic **Managed Team EPG Channels** range and choose priority teams in **Channels → Numbering**. Priority teams are numbered first when channels are created. This range is independent from event-channel numbering, so ordinary channel blocks do not consume it. Automatic numbers follow the [Number Stability](../channels/numbering#number-stability) mode: Compact re-sorts them every run, Gapped and Strict hold them until the daily re-layout. An explicit override pins a number; a collision with another channel moves it.

Managed Team EPG channels are durable, empty Dispatcharr channels when no game is on. During generation, Teamarr attaches streams matched to that team's games in any of the team's competitions, applies stream-priority rules, and releases memberships that no longer match. Every attachment has a window: an EPG-matched linear stream keeps its programme slot plus the configured buffers, and a name-matched stream gets the game itself, widened by the lifecycle pre/post buffers. A game that is final, cancelled or outside the event-channel lifecycle window never attaches. When more than one game is inside its window at once, the channel carries the one that starts soonest and switches when that game's window closes.

A stream's home/away side is read from the broadcast (feed markers in the name, or the side the stream matched), not from the team whose channel it landed on, so `home_feed`/`away_feed`/`team_feed` ordering rules behave as they do on event channels.

#### Ownership And Lifecycle

Teamarr treats a channel as managed only after it has created a record for that team. A Dispatcharr channel with the same XMLTV channel id (`tvg-id`) is still a manual channel, so Teamarr will not adopt, update, repair, or delete it. If that conflict exists when management is enabled, Teamarr reports it on the Teams page instead of creating a duplicate — delete or re-point the hand-made channel, then generate again.

Every decision that could orphan or duplicate a channel is made only on evidence: if the Dispatcharr channel list cannot be read, the run skips team-channel sync; if a mapped channel is missing from the list, Teamarr asks Dispatcharr for it directly and recreates it only on a confirmed "not found". A source whose matching failed this run keeps the memberships it produced last run, so a provider blip does not clear a game off a channel.

Turn management off from **EPG → Team EPG** to release a channel. Teamarr applies that during the next manual or scheduled generation: it removes the proven Teamarr-owned Dispatcharr channel, then its ownership and stream-membership records. If Teamarr cannot prove ownership or Dispatcharr deletion fails, the generation records the error so a manual replacement cannot be deleted accidentally. Deactivating a team is different: the channel, its number and its identity are kept, its streams are released, and its guide stops updating until the team is active again. Deleting a team removes its configuration and its proven Teamarr-owned channel immediately; a team with no managed channel can be deleted without a Dispatcharr connection.

The [Dashboard](../dashboard) lists managed team channels for status and stream audit only. Its event-channel reset, expiry, reconciliation, orphan discovery, and deletion controls do not apply to persistent Team EPG channels.

## Team EPG Settings

The **Team EPG Settings** card at the top of the page holds the behavior settings:

### Schedule Days Ahead

How far ahead to fetch team schedules. This affects the `.next` template variables that show upcoming games. More days means more programmes in the EPG but longer generation times. Default is 30 days. Options: 7, 14, 30, 60, or 90 days.

### Midnight Crossover

Controls what filler content is shown when a game crosses midnight:

- **Show postgame filler** — Display postgame content after midnight
- **Show idle filler** — Display idle/off-air content after midnight
