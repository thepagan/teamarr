# Template Conditions

Conditions let you show different programme content based on game context. Instead of a single static description, you can have multiple options that trigger based on specific situations — and each option can also override the programme **title** and **subtitle**.

## How Conditions Work

Each condition option has:
- **Condition**: What to check (e.g., `is_home`, `win_streak`)
- **Value**: For numeric conditions, the threshold (e.g., `5` for a 5-game streak)
- **Priority**: Lower numbers = higher priority (1-99 for conditionals, 100 for defaults)
- **Template**: The description to use if the condition matches
- **Title / Subtitle Override** *(optional)*: replace the programme title and/or subtitle when this condition matches — e.g. put a bowl name or `{game_event_note}` in the title for marquee games

When generating EPG, Teamarr evaluates all conditions and selects the highest-priority (lowest number) match. If multiple conditions match at the same priority, one is chosen randomly.

### Title and subtitle selection

Titles and subtitles are selected **per field, independently**: for each field, the highest-priority matching row *that defines that field* wins. A row that only sets a title leaves the description to lower-priority rows (and vice versa), and any field with no matching override falls back to the template's plain title/subtitle/description. Unlike descriptions, ties at the same priority resolve **deterministically** (first row wins) for titles and subtitles, so guide titles don't change between EPG runs.

**Example** — a marquee-game row that rewrites the whole guide entry:
```json
{"condition": "has_event_note", "priority": 15,
 "title": "{game_event_note}: {away_team} at {home_team}",
 "subtitle": "{venue_name} · {venue_city}",
 "template": "{game_event_note}. {away_team} take on {home_team} at {venue_name}."}
```

## Priority System

| Priority | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| 1-49 | High priority conditionals (rare situations) |
| 50-99 | Normal priority conditionals |
| 100 | Default fallback (always matches) |

**Lower numbers win.** A priority 10 condition beats priority 50, which beats priority 100.

## Filler Condition Rows

The same row mechanism drives the **filler registers** (pregame, postgame, and
idle) on the Fillers tab. Filler rows use the identical shape and per-field
selection rules as the main condition rows, with two filler-specific twists:

**Reference game.** Fillers have no "current game", so each register's rows
evaluate against its natural reference: **pregame → the next game**,
**postgame and idle → the last game**. Postgame and idle refresh the game's
status from the provider before evaluating, so `is_final` reflects reality
even when the cached schedule is stale. On event channels, both registers
evaluate against the channel's event. Remember the variable suffix that goes
with the reference: a team-template postgame row reads the last game via
`.last` (`{game_recap.last}`), while event-template rows use the bare form
(`{game_recap}`).

**Description cascade.** A winning row's description that resolves to an
empty string — the classic case is `{game_recap}` for a game that just ended,
before the provider publishes a recap — falls through to the next matching
row by priority, and finally to the register's base description. Fields no
matching row sets always fall back to the register's base content.

**The recap-first pattern** (what new templates and the starter set ship):

```json
[{"condition": "has_recap", "priority": 10, "template": "{game_recap.last}"},
 {"condition": "is_not_final", "priority": 50,
  "template": "The game between {team_name_the} and {opponent_the.last} has not yet ended."}]
```

Recap published → it renders verbatim. Game still running → the in-progress
line. Final but no recap → neither row fires and the base register's
constructed result line renders.

The idle register's **offseason override** (no upcoming game in the
lookahead) stays separate from condition rows — it's a no-game state, and
condition rows need a reference game to evaluate.

## Available Conditions

### Home/Away

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `is_home` | - | Team is playing at home |
| `is_away` | - | Team is playing away/on the road |

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "is_home", "priority": 50, "template": "{team_name} hosts {opponent} at {venue}"}
{"condition": "is_away", "priority": 50, "template": "{team_name} travels to face {opponent}"}
```

---

### Streaks

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `win_streak` | Minimum streak length | Team is on a winning streak >= value |
| `loss_streak` | Minimum streak length | Team is on a losing streak >= value |

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "win_streak", "condition_value": "5", "priority": 10, "template": "🔥 {team_name} riding a {win_streak}-game win streak!"}
{"condition": "loss_streak", "condition_value": "3", "priority": 20, "template": "{team_name} looking to snap a {loss_streak}-game skid"}
```

---

### Rankings (College)

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `is_ranked` | - | Team is ranked (top 25) |
| `is_ranked_opponent` | - | Opponent is ranked (top 25) |
| `is_ranked_matchup` | - | Both teams are ranked (top 25) |
| `is_top_ten_matchup` | - | Both teams are in the top 10 |

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "is_top_ten_matchup", "priority": 5, "template": "🏆 Top 10 showdown! {team_rank_display} {team_name} vs {opponent_rank_display} {opponent}"}
{"condition": "is_ranked_matchup", "priority": 15, "template": "Ranked matchup: {team_rank_display} {team_name} vs {opponent_rank_display} {opponent}"}
{"condition": "is_ranked_opponent", "priority": 30, "template": "{team_name} faces {opponent_rank_display} {opponent}"}
```

---

### Season Type

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `is_playoff` | - | Playoff/postseason game |
| `is_preseason` | - | Preseason/exhibition game |

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "is_playoff", "priority": 5, "template": "🏆 PLAYOFF: {team_name} vs {opponent}"}
{"condition": "is_preseason", "priority": 50, "template": "Preseason: {team_name} vs {opponent}"}
```

---

### Neutral Site

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `is_neutral_site` | - | Game is at a neutral site (bowls, CFP/NCAA tournament rounds, showcase games) |

Host framing ("X travel to…", "Y host X…") misrepresents a game nobody
hosts — branch to neutral prose instead. The `{at_vs}` / `{vs_at}` / `{vs_@}`
connector variables also read `vs` automatically at neutral sites, so
subtitles flip without a condition.

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "is_neutral_site", "priority": 17, "template": "{away_team} and {home_team} meet at {venue}."}
```

---

### Conference (College)

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `is_conference_game` | - | Both teams are in the same conference |

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "is_conference_game", "priority": 40, "template": "{college_conference} matchup: {team_name} vs {opponent}"}
```

---

### Broadcast

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `is_national_broadcast` | - | Game is on national TV (ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, ESPN, TNT, TBS) |

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "is_national_broadcast", "priority": 60, "template": "{team_name} vs {opponent} on {broadcast_network}"}
```

---

### Odds

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `has_odds` | - | Betting odds are available for this game |

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "has_odds", "priority": 70, "template": "{team_name} ({odds_spread}) vs {opponent}. O/U: {odds_over_under}"}
```

---

### Game State

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `is_final` | - | The reference game is final |
| `is_not_final` | - | The reference game exists but is not final yet |

Both return false when there is no reference game at all. They're a deliberate pair rather than one condition and its negation: rows for "game over" and "game still going" stay independent, so a field one row doesn't set falls through to your defaults instead of leaking from the other state.

These shine in [filler condition rows](#filler-condition-rows), where the reference game is the register's next/last game with freshly-checked status.

---

### Provider Copy (ESPN)

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `has_preview` | - | Provider preview blurb is available (populates same-day pregame) |
| `has_recap` | - | Provider recap headline is available (populates once the game is final) |
| `has_structured_preview` | - | Recent-form data is available (populates days ahead) |
| `has_event_note` | - | Marquee/playoff note is available (`NBA Finals - Game 5`, `CFP Quarterfinal at the Cotton Bowl Classic`); empty for ordinary games |
| `has_match_note` | - | Soccer competition note is available (`FIFA World Cup, Group C`); soccer only |

Use these to prefer ESPN's editorial copy and fall back to constructed prose
when it isn't published yet — the pattern the starter templates ship with:

**Example:**
```json
[
  {"condition": "has_preview", "priority": 10, "template": "{game_preview}"},
  {"condition": "has_event_note", "priority": 15, "template": "{game_event_note}. {team_name} vs {opponent} at {venue}"},
  {"priority": 100, "template": "{team_name} vs {opponent} at {venue}"}
]
```

---

### Opponent

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `opponent_name_contains` | Search string | Opponent name contains the specified text (case-insensitive) |

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "opponent_name_contains", "condition_value": "Rival", "priority": 20, "template": "🔥 Rivalry game! {team_name} vs {opponent}"}
```

### League / Sport

| Condition | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `league_is` | League code(s), comma-separated | Event's league matches one of the given codes (case-insensitive), e.g. `cfb` or `cfb,nfl` |
| `sport_is` | Sport code(s), comma-separated | Event's sport matches one of the given codes (case-insensitive), e.g. `football,basketball` |

Available to both team and event templates — one template can branch its description by league or sport instead of needing a separate template variant per league.

**Example:**
```json
{"condition": "league_is", "condition_value": "cfb", "priority": 15, "template": "College football: {away_team} at {home_team}"}
```

---

## Default Descriptions

Priority 100 is reserved for default descriptions that always match. You should always have at least one default as a fallback.

```json
{"priority": 100, "template": "{team_name} vs {opponent}"}
```

If you have multiple defaults (all at priority 100), one is chosen randomly - useful for variety.

## Complete Example

Here's a complete set of conditions for a college football team template:

```json
[
  {"condition": "is_playoff", "priority": 5, "template": "🏆 PLAYOFF: {team_name} vs {opponent}"},
  {"condition": "is_top_ten_matchup", "priority": 10, "template": "🔥 Top 10 clash! {team_rank_display} {team_name} vs {opponent_rank_display} {opponent}"},
  {"condition": "win_streak", "condition_value": "5", "priority": 15, "template": "{team_name} riding a {win_streak}-game win streak vs {opponent}"},
  {"condition": "is_ranked_matchup", "priority": 20, "template": "Ranked matchup: {team_rank_display} {team_name} vs {opponent_rank_display} {opponent}"},
  {"condition": "is_ranked_opponent", "priority": 30, "template": "{team_name} faces {opponent_rank_display} {opponent}"},
  {"condition": "is_conference_game", "priority": 40, "template": "{college_conference} game: {team_name} vs {opponent}"},
  {"condition": "is_home", "priority": 50, "template": "{team_name} hosts {opponent} at {venue}"},
  {"condition": "is_away", "priority": 50, "template": "{team_name} travels to face {opponent}"},
  {"priority": 100, "template": "{team_name} vs {opponent}"}
]
```

**Evaluation order:**
1. If it's a playoff game → use playoff template (priority 5)
2. Else if both teams are top 10 → use top 10 template (priority 10)
3. Else if team has 5+ game win streak → use win streak template (priority 15)
4. Else if both teams ranked → use ranked matchup template (priority 20)
5. Else if opponent is ranked → use ranked opponent template (priority 30)
6. Else if same conference → use conference template (priority 40)
7. Else if home game → use home template (priority 50)
8. Else if away game → use away template (priority 50)
9. Otherwise → use default template (priority 100)
