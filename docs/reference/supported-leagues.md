# Supported Sports & Leagues

Teamarr supports **170 pre-configured leagues** across 15 sports, plus **~228 dynamically discovered soccer leagues** from ESPN. Most pre-configured leagues have full support (team import + event matching) — see the Support Levels table below for the event-only exceptions. Discovered leagues support event matching only.

## Support Levels

Leagues have different levels of support:

| Level | Team Import | Event Matching | Description |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Full** | Yes | Yes | Teams can be added for team-based channels; streams matched to events |
| **Event Only** | No | Yes | Event groups can match streams to events; no team import |

{: .note }
**Team Import** = Add teams to Teams page for dedicated team channels
**Event Matching** = Event groups can match M3U streams to sporting events

{: .warning }
Motorsports are **Event Only** - no team import available.

| League | ID | Provider | Type |
|--------|-----|----------|------|
| Formula 1 | `f1` | ESPN | Event |

[TSDB provider docs](providers/tsdb.md) for the IMSA/WEC session grouping.

`racing/motogp` endpoint returns no usable schedule or logo data.

## Tennis

{: .warning }
Tennis is **Event Only** - no team import available (players, not teams).

| League | ID | Provider | Type |
|--------|-----|----------|------|
| ATP Tour | `atp` | ESPN | Event |

Tennis is matched **per match** — one channel per match, with the two players
filling the home/away variables plus tennis-specific variables
(`{player1}`, `{player2}`, `{tournament_name}`, `{tennis_round}`, …).
Court and round day-feeds fan out to every match on that court/round for the
day. See the [ESPN provider docs](providers/espn) for grand-slam draw

## Adding New Leagues

New leagues are added to the `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO leagues` block in `teamarr/database/schema.sql`. Each league requires a provider, league ID, display name, sport, and optionally logos and TSDB tier. See the [Providers](providers/) section for details on each provider's ID format.

If you need a league that isn't listed here, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Pharaoh-Labs/teamarr/issues).
