# Agent Instructions - Teamarr

## Overview

Sports EPG generator. Uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Start with `bd ready`.

## Support Bundle Contract

When changing support-bundle schemas, archive layout, collection limits, redaction, or signal codes, update the implementation, tests, user documentation, bundled `AGENTS.md`, and this instruction in the same change. Never add a generic database dump or relax exclusions for stream URLs, M3U account names, credentials, or tokens without an explicit security decision. Redaction is key-name based and recurses into JSON-typed columns (`emby_servers`, `jellyfin_servers`, …) — a new column that stores nested credentials as text is covered only because `_sanitize` parses JSON strings (#686); never bypass that path.

## CRITICAL: Database Safety

**NEVER delete `teamarr.db` or `data/teamarr.db`.** The database contains user-configured teams, templates, settings, and history that cannot be recreated. Schema changes use migrations (`INSERT OR REPLACE`, `ALTER TABLE`) - deleting the database is NEVER required and will cause data loss.

**Stack**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLite | Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind

**Frontend routes are code-split (#737).** Pages are `React.lazy`'d in `App.tsx` from their own modules; Dashboard alone stays eager because it is the landing route. When adding a page, import the **module** (`@/pages/Thing`), never the `@/pages` barrel — a barrel import pulls every page back into one chunk and the only symptom is the entry bundle quietly growing (it was 1.03 MB before this). `vite.config.ts` also pins React/Router/Query into a `vendor` chunk so a release invalidates app code only.

## Start of Session

1. Re-read this file and follow it exactly
2. Switch to `dev` branch: `git checkout dev && git pull`
3. Check for work: `bd ready`

If you forget this workflow after a context compaction, re-read this file before continuing.

## Local Testing

Run `./dev.sh` to start both servers in one terminal:

```bash
./dev.sh                 # fast restart — skips cache refresh
./dev.sh --update-cache  # restart with full cache refresh
```

- **Backend** (FastAPI): `http://localhost:9195` — Python venv, `app.py`
- **Frontend** (Vite HMR): `http://localhost:5173` — proxies `/api` → `:9195`

Use `:5173` during development for hot-reload. `Ctrl+C` stops both.
Re-running `./dev.sh` kills existing servers first, so it doubles as a restart.

By default the script skips the startup cache refresh for fast restarts. Pass `--update-cache` when you need fresh team/league data from providers. Cache can also be refreshed manually via the UI button.

**Always use `./dev.sh` to start or restart the dev environment.** It handles cleanup of old processes automatically.

**When to restart:**
- After making backend (Python) code changes
- If Playwright browser automation can't connect to `localhost:5173`
- After schema or configuration changes

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
bd ready                              # Find available work
bd show <id>                          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress   # Claim work
bd close <id>                         # Complete work
bd doctor                             # Check beads health (sync issues, hooks)
```

**Beads sync is Dolt, not JSONL.** The shared source of truth is `refs/dolt/data`
on origin (set up 2026-08-29). `bd dolt pull` at session start, `bd dolt push` at
session end — **every machine, every session**, including co-devs. `.beads/*.jsonl`
is a passive export: never `bd import` it as a sync step, and its presence in a
PR does not carry beads across machines. A fresh clone gets beads with
`bd bootstrap`. A machine whose Dolt history has diverged (push says "no common
ancestor") must `bd export -o mine.jsonl` → `bd bootstrap` → `bd import -i
mine.jsonl` → `bd dolt push` — never `--force` from a non-maintainer machine.

## Development Workflow (issue-first — MANDATORY)

**Nothing gets implemented without a GitHub issue.** Every feature, bug fix, and refactor — including internally-discovered work — follows this lifecycle. No coding straight onto `dev`.

### The Lifecycle: issue → bead → claim → branch → PR → dev → release

1. **Issue first** — `gh issue create` (or an existing community issue). Applies to internal work too. *Sole exception:* trivial bookkeeping (beads sync, typo, one-line doc fix) may batch under a standing "Housekeeping" issue for the release cycle instead of individual issues.
2. **Bead it** — `bd create` referencing the issue: put `(#NNN)` in the bead title. Larger features get an epic + child beads (see Roadmap & Feature Planning). Comment the bead id on the issue so the two stay linked.
3. **Claim** — `bd update <id> --status in_progress` BEFORE writing code.
4. **Branch** — from up-to-date dev:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev && git pull
   git checkout -b <type>/<issue#>-<slug>    # type ∈ feat|fix|refactor|chore|docs
   ```
5. **Implement on the branch** — code, then docs-impact evaluation (MANDATORY — check every change against the Documentation Updates table below; doc updates ship in the same branch), then quality gates (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   ruff check teamarr/ tests/
   pytest tests/ -v
   cd frontend && npm run build
   ```
6. **Open a PR to dev when gates are green** — CI (`test.yml`, `dependency-review`) runs **only on `pull_request`**, so a direct merge to dev skips the test gate. Internal work goes through a PR too:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch>
   gh pr create --base dev --fill
   ```
   Wait for checks green, then merge via GitHub: `gh pr merge <#> --merge --delete-branch`. Then comment the dev-land hash on the issue, add the `status: on-dev` label (**keep the issue open** — it closes at release), and close the bead.
   *Exception:* trivial bookkeeping (beads sync, typo, one-line doc fix) may merge straight to dev under the standing Housekeeping issue — no PR needed.
7. **Release to main in batches** — `dev → main` happens ONLY via the Release Workflow below. **Release triggers** (any one): a user-facing regression fix is waiting on dev · ~2–3 weeks since the last release · dev is ≥25 commits ahead of main. Dev must never again pile up 100+ unreleased commits.
8. **At release** — close every `status: on-dev` issue with the release link.

### Inbound community PRs

- Triage every new PR promptly: comment with an assessment and expected timeline.
- Review-ready PRs get attention **before** starting new self-initiated work.
- Merge via GitHub when possible; take-and-fix with credit when conflicts force it. Always credit contributors in the changelog (`— thanks @user (#PR)`).

### Session rules

- **Start:** `git checkout dev && git pull` · `bd dolt pull` · `bd ready` · `gh pr list` (triage anything new).
- **End:** `bd dolt push` · everything committed AND pushed (work is incomplete until push succeeds — never stop before pushing, never say "ready to push when you are"); report whether dev currently meets a release trigger.

### Roadmap & Feature Planning

Use beads epics to plan larger features:

```bash
bd create "Feature name" --type epic --label roadmap
bd create "Implementation step 1" --parent <epic-id>
bd create "Implementation step 2" --parent <epic-id>
bd dep add <step2-id> <step1-id>    # step 2 blocked by step 1
```

When asked to plan a feature, create an epic with implementation beads that have proper blockers and predecessors. Use `bd list --label roadmap` to see the roadmap.

### Release Workflow (`/release`)

When the user says **"release"**, **"/release"**, or **"version bump"**, execute this workflow:

1. **Determine scope** — `git log origin/main..origin/dev --oneline` to see all commits in the release
2. **Ask version** — suggest patch (x.y.Z) vs minor (x.Y.0) based on scope. User decides.
3. **Quality gates** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ruff check teamarr/ tests/
   pytest tests/ -v
   cd frontend && npm run build
   ```
4. **Version bump** — edit `pyproject.toml` line 7, commit "Bump version to x.y.z"
5. **Push dev** — `git push origin dev`
6. **Merge to main** — fast-forward merge:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git merge dev --no-edit
   git push origin main
   git checkout dev
   ```
7. **Create GitHub release** — `gh release create v<version> --repo Pharaoh-Labs/teamarr --target main` with summarized release notes (not commit-by-commit — group into categories). CI notes: the tag push triggers `release.yml`, which sees the release already exists and skips (it only auto-creates releases for raw tag pushes); Docker publish and release are gated on the Tests workflow and on the tag matching `pyproject.toml`'s version — a mismatched tag will not publish.
8. **Generate Discord changelog** — use the Release Template below, output ready to paste
9. **Update plans/STATUS.md** — add release to changelog, update version

**Push-button alternative (`Cut Release` workflow, #281):** Actions tab → "Cut Release" → Run workflow from `dev`, pick patch/minor/major (or an explicit version). CI re-runs the gates, bumps `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`, pushes the bump to dev, fast-forwards main, pushes the tag, opens a **draft** release, and dispatches the Docker publishes for `main` and the tag (explicit dispatch — `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes don't trigger workflows). Steps 7–9 stay manual: write curated notes on the draft and publish it, generate the Discord changelog, update `plans/STATUS.md`. After a Cut Release run, `git pull` locally — the bump commit lands on dev via the bot.

**Rules:**
- Never release with failing tests or lint errors
- Release notes should be human-readable summaries, not raw commit messages
- Group related commits into single bullet points

## Changelog Format

When asked for a changelog, **always** produce Discord-ready markdown. Two templates:

### Dev Push Template

Get version from `pyproject.toml` line 7, append `-dev+<short_hash>` of HEAD commit.

```
## 🚀 v<version>-dev+<hash> — <YYYY-MM-DD>

🐛 **Bug Fixes**
- <one-liner> (#issue) (`hash`)

✨ **New Features**
- <one-liner> (#issue) (`hash`)

⚡ **Enhancements**
- <one-liner> (#issue) (`hash`)

🎨 **UI/UX**
- <one-liner> (#issue) (`hash`)

🔧 **Under the Hood**
- <one-liner> — thanks @contributor (#PR) (`hash`)
```

### Release Template

Identical sections to the Dev Push Template, with two differences: the header is `## 🎉 v<version> — <YYYY-MM-DD>` and items carry **no commit hashes** (releases omit them).

### Rules
- Discord markdown (## headers, **bold**, \`code\`)
- Categories (in order): 🐛 Bug Fixes, ✨ New Features, ⚡ Enhancements, 🎨 UI/UX, 🔧 Under the Hood
- **Omit empty categories** — only include sections that have items
- Dev pushes include commit hashes; releases do not
- **ALWAYS include issue numbers** — append `(#123)` to items that close or relate to a GitHub issue
- **ALWAYS credit contributors** — append `— thanks @username (#PR)` for community PR contributions
- Each item is one concise line — no multi-line descriptions
- No extra commentary — just the changelog block ready to paste

## Git Remote & Preferences

**Single remote:**
| Remote | Repo | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `origin` | `Pharaoh-Labs/teamarr` | All development, releases, and PRs |

**Rules:**
- Push to `origin dev` after completing work
- No commit watermarks or co-authored-by
- Concise, focused commit messages

## Documentation Updates

**Part of every development cycle.** After implementing any change, check this table *before* running quality gates. If a row matches, updating the listed docs is as much a part of the task as the code itself — don't defer it to a future sweep and don't wait for the user to prompt. Docs commits can ride in the same commit as the code or a paired follow-up; either way, they ship together.

| Change Type | Update |
|-------------|--------|
| New/renamed/removed template variable | `teamarr/templates/variables/` docstring AND `docs/guide/epg/variables.md` AND variable-count claims in `docs/guide/epg/variables.md`, `docs/reference/architecture/template-engine.md`, `docs/index.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` ("Key Subsystems") |
| New/renamed/removed condition evaluator | `teamarr/templates/conditions.py` docstring AND `docs/guide/epg/conditions.md` AND condition-count claims |
| New/renamed/removed league | `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO leagues` in `schema.sql` AND the appropriate sport section of `docs/reference/supported-leagues.md` AND league-count claims in `docs/reference/supported-leagues.md`, `docs/reference/index.md`, `docs/index.md`, and `docs/reference/providers/<provider>.md` |
| New/renamed sport | `INSERT INTO sports` in `schema.sql` AND `docs/reference/supported-leagues.md` sport list AND sport-count claims |
| New API endpoint | Route docstring AND OpenAPI (auto) AND relevant `docs/reference/architecture/*.md` if the endpoint shape changes subsystem behavior |
| New column | `CREATE TABLE` in `schema.sql` (reconciliation handles upgrades); no doc update needed unless the column is user-visible |
| Data migration | Versioned block in `_run_migrations()`, bump `schema_version` DEFAULT, AND update schema version in `docs/reference/architecture/migrations.md` |
| New provider | Architecture section in this file AND `docs/reference/providers/<name>.md` (new file) AND `docs/reference/supported-leagues.md` provider table |
| Config/settings change | `README.md` if user-facing, AND relevant `docs/guide/settings/*.md` page |
| New feature (user-visible) | README Features section AND appropriate `docs/guide/**` page; consider creating a guide page if substantial |
| Feature removal | Remove from docs (don't leave stale references); add to release notes |

If the change touches a count referenced in docs (variables, leagues, sports, conditions, schema version), grep for the old number across `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `README.md` — don't fix just one occurrence.

## Single Source of Truth

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Version | `pyproject.toml` line 7 |
| Dependencies | `pyproject.toml` (ranges) + `uv.lock` (pinned, used by the Docker build) — run `uv lock` after any dependency change or `--frozen` builds fail |
| League configs | `teamarr/database/schema.sql` |
| Schema version | `teamarr/database/schema.sql` (v96) |
| Schema reconciliation | `teamarr/database/reconciliation.py` |
| Provider registration | `teamarr/providers/__init__.py` |

## Architecture

```
API Layer        → teamarr/api/routes/ (18 modules)
Consumer Layer   → teamarr/consumers/ (key packages: generation, team_epg, event_epg, event_group_processor/, cache/, lifecycle/, matching/, enforcement/, filler/)
Service Layer    → teamarr/services/sports_data.py
Provider Layer   → teamarr/providers/ (espn, bellmedia, squiggle, nascar, mlbstats, hockeytech, supabase, tsdb)
```

**Providers** (lower priority = tried first):
- ESPN (0) - Primary, most leagues
- Bell Media (20) - CFL, CHL, OHL, WHL, QMJHL, AHL, PWHL; TSN public sports widget API, no key
- Squiggle (30) - AFL (Australian Football League); free, no key required
- NASCAR (35) - NASCAR Cup/O'Reilly (Xfinity)/Trucks; official cf.nascar.com schedule API, full weekend sessions, no key
- MLB Stats (40) - MiLB (Triple-A through Rookie)
- HockeyTech (50) - ECHL, USHL, Canadian Junior A
- Supabase (55) - Supabase-backed leagues (CBL, etc.)
- TSDB (100) - Cricket, rugby, boxing, Scandinavian leagues, uru.2 — premium key required (#676); keyless = provider not registered

**ESPN MMA cards are keyed on sport, not league code (#756).** Every card path in the ESPN provider (`get_events`, `get_sample_candidates`, `get_recent_final`) asks `_is_mma(league)`, which reads the league's **sport** from the leagues table, so a new promotion is a `schema.sql` row and nothing else; `MMA_LEAGUES = {ufc, pfl, lfa}` is only the fallback for when that lookup can't answer (bare provider, DB predating the row) and the source of truth for `LEAGUES_WITHOUT_SUMMARY`/`LEAGUES_WITHOUT_TEAMS`. `mma.py` (formerly `ufc.py`) threads the league code through the parser; `consumers/mma_segments.py::is_mma_event` gates on `sport == "mma"` so every promotion gets the prelims/main-card split. **Bout order does not identify the main event** — UFC and PFL list it last, LFA lists it *first*, and same-time cards give the clock nothing to sort on. `_select_main_event` matches the card's own name ("LFA 228: Natividad vs. Garcia") against each bout's competitors and falls back to the last bout only when the name carries no fighter names ("PFL Dubai", "UFC 335"). Measured over ESPN's 2025-26 slates: 103/103 UFC and every PFL card unchanged, 12/36 LFA cards corrected. Note ESPN files most other promotions (Cage Warriors, OKTAGON, RIZIN, ONE, PFL MENA/Africa) under a catch-all `mma/other` bucket, not their own slugs — adding it would need league-hint scoping in `_match_event_card`, which currently tries every configured event-card league in order.

**Dispatcharr Sync Reliability** (`lifecycle/service.py`):
All `update_channel` calls go through `_safe_update_channel`, which checks `OperationResult.success` before persisting to local DB. On API failure, the DB stays unchanged so drift is re-detected on the next generation run. Profile sync also compares against Dispatcharr's actual state (`current_channel.channel_profile_ids`) for self-healing. Reconciliation (`reconciliation.py`) detects stream and profile drift as additional drift fields.

**`StreamMatchCache.session()` batches commits, not just connections (#742).** Write methods call `self._commit(conn)`, which is a no-op while a session is pinned — the session's context exit commits once. Any new write method must use it rather than `conn.commit()`, or it silently reintroduces an fsync per stream (2,300+ per run on a real install, and fsync on network-backed storage dominates the match phase). Losing an uncommitted tail to a crash is acceptable here and nowhere else: the table is a cache and every row is re-derivable.

**Dispatcharr catalogs are memoized for the UI (#736).** `M3UManager.list_accounts` and `list_groups` hold a 60s memo (`_ACCOUNTS_TTL_SECONDS` / `_GROUPS_TTL_SECONDS`); the Sources list called both live on every page load, and profiling put 93% of `/api/v1/groups` inside `list_accounts` alone. A **failed** fetch is never cached (a blip must not blank account names for a minute), the memo holds the *unfiltered* list so `include_custom` / `search` / `exclude_m3u` still apply per call, and mutations invalidate explicitly — add an `invalidate_accounts_cache()` / `_groups_fetched_at = None` to any new write path against those endpoints. Connection status has its own probe: `DispatcharrFactory.probe_connection` makes ONE request on the **pooled** connection and memoizes the verdict for 15s, keyed on the same settings hash `get_connection` reconnects on. Do not point the status poll back at `test_connection` — that builds a throwaway client and makes three calls, one of which pulls every channel group just to count it (1.09s per poll, every 30s, per open tab). `test_connection` stays as-is for the Test button, which wants a real uncached round trip and those counts.

**Stream order converges every run (#712).** Array order in a `{"streams": [...]}` push IS the channel's stream priority, so every comparison of DB vs Dispatcharr streams must be *ordered* — a `set()` or `sorted()` on either side silently blinds it. `_apply_stream_ordering` reads Dispatcharr's real order once per run (`channel_mgr.get_channels()`, cached) and pushes on any difference; gating on local priority *change* alone was the #712 bug, since priorities are computed at insert time and so never change on a steady-state channel. Reconciliation's drift `expected` must be the priority order — it is written straight back to Dispatcharr by the auto-fix. The one legitimate DB↔Dispatcharr order difference is the live-event #1 pin (#232), which both the audit and reconciliation exempt while the event is live.

**`_apply_stream_ordering` runs in three phases (#735) — keep them separate.** Phase 1 (serial, one DB connection) recomputes and persists priorities and builds an `_OrderingPlan` per channel; phase 2 (still serial, still DB) takes ONE `get_all_ordered_stream_ids` scan for the post-update active sets and decides what to push; phase 3 runs the PATCHes on a bounded pool (`_ORDERING_PUSH_WORKERS`) **outside** the `with db_factory()` block, so no thread ever touches the connection. Do not move a Dispatcharr call back into the channel loop, and do not move a DB write into the push helper. The bulk reads (`get_all_channel_streams` / `get_all_ordered_stream_ids`) replace two queries per channel; the second takes an explicit `now` so every channel's attach/detach window is evaluated at one instant rather than re-reading the clock per channel. `paginated_get` fetches pages 2..N concurrently once page 1 reports a usable `count`, and on a failed page returns a contiguous **prefix**, never a list with a hole in it — callers cannot tell a hole from a smaller collection. Page size is measured from page 1's length, never assumed from the query string: `/api/epg/epgdata/` ignores `page_size` and answers with every row at once.

## Key Subsystems

**Template Engine** (`teamarr/templates/`):
- 266 variables in `variables/` (20 categories); chainable `|filter` transforms in `filters.py` (lower/upper/title/pascal/slug/urlencode) with permanent legacy aliases for 10 retired transform variables
- 33 condition evaluators in `conditions.py`
- Suffix rules: `.next`, `.last` for multi-game scenarios
- Template scope: each variable is tagged `TemplateScope.ALL` / `TEAM_ONLY` / `EVENT_ONLY` — gates variable picker by template type via `GET /variables?template_type=…`

**Settings Registry** (`teamarr/database/settings/`, bead `teamarr-iua3.8`):
- Each setting is declared once: a typed dataclass field in `types.py` plus a column/JSON/hook binding in `registry.py` (`GROUPS`). `read.py` and `update.py` are generic (registry-driven); group-specific behavior (validation, relayout arming, clear-to-NULL, `_NOT_PROVIDED` sentinels) lives in the update wrappers — public signatures are stable, don't change them without auditing callers.
- Adding a setting: add the column to `schema.sql` + the field to its dataclass; touch `registry.py` only if the column name differs from the field name or it needs JSON/custom parse/dump hooks. Parity tests (`tests/test_settings_registry.py`) enforce schema ↔ registry ↔ dataclass ↔ Pydantic alignment.
- API routes build responses with `to_model(Model, dataclass)` from `api/routes/settings/models.py`; frontend hooks are factory-generated with scoped cache invalidation (`frontend/src/hooks/useSettings.ts`).

**Dynamic Groups** (`teamarr/consumers/lifecycle/dynamic_resolver.py`):
- `{sport}`, `{league}`, `{conference}`, `{conference_abbrev}`, and `{division}` wildcards — the conference ones resolve the home team's NCAA conference from `provider_group_cache` (#91; abbrev #777, division #717)
- Auto-creates in Dispatcharr
- **Group/profile names are keyed through `_group_key` — trim + lowercase, never collapse internal whitespace (#745).** Both `create_channel_group` and `create_profile` post `name.strip()`, so a name differing only at the ends can never create what it was looking for: the cache lookup misses, Dispatcharr refuses the create as a duplicate of the group that was already there, the channel gets a null `channel_group_id`, and it repeats every run because nothing about that state changes. Collapsing *internal* runs looks like the same idea and is not safe — on a live install's 3,097 groups, trimming collided 0 keys while collapsing collided 18, all real distinct groups separated only by `\xa0` vs a regular space. Any new name→id cache against Dispatcharr must go through `_group_key` on both populate and lookup.

**Per-Source Matching Types** (epic `teamarr-ahow`):
- Each source declares which matching pipeline(s) it runs — three independent booleans on `event_epg_groups`: `name_match_enabled` (Stream Name → TEAM_VS_TEAM/EVENT_CARD/RACING categories), `team_streams_enabled` (Team → TEAM_ONLY), `epg_match_enabled` (EPG). Multi-select; ≥1 required (enforced in `api/routes/groups.py::require_matching_type`).
- Gating is by **category at the matcher router** (`matcher.py::_match_single`, reason `name_match_disabled`) — classification always runs so the types stay independent; never skip `classify_stream`. `name_match_enabled` defaults 1 (DEFAULT-1 column backfills existing sources). The hidden `is_channel_source` group is name-off (EPG/team only).
- UI: three toggles on add/edit/bulk-add/bulk-edit; color-coded Sources badges (Stream Name=sky, Team=emerald, EPG=violet). The Matched-column coverage % shows only when Stream Name is on (Team/EPG fan one stream → many events).

**Fixture Gate** (epic `teamarr-goax`, `teamarr/consumers/matching/identity.py`):
- Cross-sport false positives came from `token_set_ratio` weighing every token equally, so a shared **city** cleared `BOTH_TEAMS_THRESHOLD` (60) on its own — "Tampa Bay Lightning"/"Tampa Bay Rays" = 78.3. 161 such cross-league pairs exist in the 6 major pro leagues alone; "New York Mets"/"New York Jets" = 92.3.
- `TeamIdentityIndex` resolves each stream side against the **global** `team_cache` (all leagues, incl. unconfigured ones) and yields the leagues where both sides could actually meet. `_match_against_candidates` skips candidates outside that set → `FailedReason.FIXTURE_NOT_IN_LEAGUE`.
- **Veto-only, never a selector** — resolution is a strong negative signal and a weak positive one (`D-backs` resolves to "ACL D-backs"; `SF Giants` and `NY Giants` give the same 4-way tie). Ties are kept, not collapsed. Returns `None` (defer) whenever it cannot speak, so an unseeded cache is inert.
- **Only a full name is an exact identity (#619).** `team_short_name` is the bare city/school for college, MLS, NWSL and most non-US rows ("Milwaukee" = Milwaukee Panthers, "Atlanta" = Atlanta United), and TSDB stores the code as the short name ("SEA" = Seattle Orcas) — every one of those is also a normal broadcast label for the pro team. Short names, the city prefix of a full name ("new york" from "New York Mets"), and every ≥2-token leading run of a full name ("fairmont state" from "Fairmont State Falcons", #650) are *partial* readings: they widen the identity set, never narrow it. Short codes union the abbreviation table with any such row and are never exact, and since #789 non-short-code texts also carry their abbreviation readings — a bare label that equals another team's full name ("Roma" = the women's club, exact) must still widen to the club it names by code (ROMA = AS Roma), or the pair vetoed the very fixture it named. A bare-city `TEAM_ALIASES` key ("atlanta" → "atlanta united") is exact only when the text has no partial reading. The matcher also never vetoes a league the index has no teams for (`knows_league`).
- **Mascotless leagues must not shadow mascoted ones (#650).** NCAA soccer (`usa.ncaa.w.1`/`usa.ncaa.m.1`, ~490 rows) publishes no mascots, so its full name IS the bare school — an *exact* identity for "Fairmont State". ESPN abbreviates the SCHOOL for college ("Fairmont State Falcons" → "Fairmont St"), never the mascot, so the short-name prefix rule never fires and the football row had no route back from the school-only form. One such side narrowed the fixture to soccer and vetoed `college-football` for **20 of 73** games on the 2026-08-29 slate (512 of 1026 failures in a support bundle). Fixed by registering every ≥2-token prefix of a full name as a partial reading; prefixes stop at two tokens so a bare "north"/"saint" never enters thousands of teams.
- **One candidate loop (#660).** `_match_against_events` (single-league) and `_match_against_multi_league_events` are thin wrappers over `_match_against_candidates`; they used to be two 89%-identical copies and the #627 league-hint hatch landed in only one of them, which is how #650's single-league NCAAF sources kept vetoing. `TestPathParity` pins both entry points to the same verdict — add gates/fallbacks to the shared body, never to a wrapper.
- No schedule lookup and no new API calls: the candidate event's own existence IS the schedule evidence.
- **The candidate loop skips provable non-work (#742).** `_score_teams_against_event` scores team1 against both event sides first and returns early when neither clears `BOTH_TEAMS_THRESHOLD`: `best = max(min(t1h,t2a), min(t1a,t2h)) <= max(t1h,t1a)`, so team2 cannot rescue the pair and its two side scores are wasted. Gate on team1 beating *either* side, never *both* — the stricter form drops legitimate matches. The window check is likewise hoisted out of the per-stream loop (it depends only on the event and the group's `target_date`) but deliberately kept, because candidates also arrive via `shared_events` from groups whose `target_date` may differ. Measured on a live 451-stream source: 10.2s → 4.0s with byte-identical verdicts.
- **Candidate token index (#747, `candidate_index.py`) — OFF by default, `TEAMARR_TOKEN_INDEX=1`.** An inverted token→events index narrows the candidate list so a stream visits only events sharing a word with it; an event sharing no word cannot clear a `token_set_ratio` floor, so it can only remove candidates no scorer would have accepted. Measured on a live install: 3,360,004 candidate visits → 69,038 (−97.9%), 13.76s → 2.07s across 11 sources, **byte-identical result signatures**. Three things are load-bearing and must not be "simplified": (1) `short_name` and `abbreviation` are indexed alongside full names — names alone lost **8.98%** of real matches, because `MORG vs. ASU` shares no full-name token with `Arizona State Sun Devils v Morgan State Bears`; alias expansion was measured and adds nothing. (2) It narrows **only** TEAM_VS_TEAM streams against the shared `_prefetched_candidates` tuple — tennis/racing/event-card and per-stream single-league lists keep the full scan. (3) `narrow()` returns `None` (defer, keep everything) when it cannot speak, and an empty *list* only when the stream has tokens and nothing shares one. The window filter and `league→count` map are memoized per batch for the same reason: they give the index a candidate sequence with a stable identity, which is the difference between building it once per batch and once per stream. `_fixture_rejected_outside` re-derives the fixture-gate count over narrowed-away candidates in O(leagues) — including the #627 league-hint hatch — so `FIXTURE_NOT_IN_LEAGUE` survives narrowing; without it, 95 streams silently downgraded to `NO_EVENT_FOUND`.
- **Negative match caching (#754, `_CACHEABLE_FAILED_REASONS`) — OFF by default, `TEAMARR_NEGATIVE_CACHE=1`.** 49% of match time went to streams that never match, costing what a matching stream costs (1.19ms vs 1.33ms), and the same streams failed identically every run. `StreamMatchCache.set_failed`/`is_failed_cached` had existed unwired since forever. Three rules are load-bearing: (1) **allowlist, never a denylist** — a `FailedReason` not in the set is re-matched, so adding a reason can never silently suppress matches, and the failure mode here is invisible (a match that just stops appearing). Membership was measured over 24 consecutive production run pairs by asking "did a stream that failed in run N match in run N+1?": cacheable reasons flip at 0.000-0.040%, while `no_epg_program_match` (0.335%), `no_event_card_match` (0.507%) and `date_mismatch` (1.105%) are an order of magnitude churnier and stay out. (2) A hit must replay the **exact stored `FailedReason`** — `set_failed(reason=…)` persists it in `cached_event_data` — because a generic verdict would flatten the failure taxonomy the UI reads (the #747 trap). A row with no reason, or a reason no longer allowlisted, is treated as a miss. (3) Only cache when **every** outcome failed with the **same** reason: a TEAM_ONLY fan-out with one hit has matched. (4) **Cached failures are invalidated by config changes (#757)** — `invalidate_team_identity_caches()` and every alias mutation route call `StreamMatchCache.clear_failed()`. Without it a user who adds an alias or refreshes the team cache sees their fix do nothing for up to the TTL, because the stale verdict short-circuits before the newly-fixed logic runs; that was immediate before #754 and is a regression, not a trade-off. Any new write path against team identity, aliases or league membership must clear failures too. `clear_failed` never touches successes (validated on read) or user corrections (pinned). The check sits after `classify_stream` (which always runs first), so `unclassifiable` is not a target despite its 8.7% share.
- **Profiling notes, so the next person skips the dead ends.** Three structural ideas were measured and refuted: bucketing candidates by league removes only 22% of pair visits (the fixture gate defers on ~70% of streams); narrowing the match window 30d→7d drops only 7.8% of events; and thread-parallelising the groups phase is pointless because matching profiles at **98.4% pure Python**. Note also that `MATCH_WINDOW_DAYS = 30` is hardcoded and the `event_match_days_back` setting never reaches the name matcher — it only bounds the EPG program window.
- **Extracted sides are refined against the team-surface index before scoring (#799).** Providers wrap team names in junk — competition labels (`B1G Football - Howard`, `Big 12 Football: Washington St.`), network suffixes (`Indiana (Big Ten Network)`), venue tails (`West Brom @ London`), pipe metadata (`TOLEDO | 9.12 | ESPN+`) — and every shape used to be another anchored regex in `_clean_team_name` (its show-prefix rule cannot see a digit or a dash) or another `ABBREVIATION_STOPWORDS` entry. `TeamMatcher._refine_sides` (called once per stream at the top of the one candidate loop, never in a wrapper — #660) asks `TeamIdentityIndex.refine_side` for the longest run of tokens that is a known surface (full/short names, #650 prefixes, #480 alias keys, code-cased abbreviations) and writes the verbatim slice back to `ctx` **and** `classified`, so the scorer, the token index (#747), the fixture gate, the negative cache and the stored `parsed_team1/2` all see the team. Three guards make it a pure strip and never a widening: (1) no team the run could name may claim a stripped token (`SF Giants` keeps its SF — the #569 discriminator — and a club suffix keeps `Dallas FC` whole); (2) bare words flush against the span are never stripped unless they are a known label — `Oklahoma State`/`Ohio Wesleyan`/`Georgia Tech` stay whole when the cache lacks that team, which the fuzzy path then correctly refuses; a punctuation or digit token is the boundary providers actually write; (3) labels come from data — `leagues.display_name`/`league_alias`, `sports.display_name`, `provider_group_cache` conference names via `load_label_surfaces` — never a list in code. **Codes count only when the stream writes them as codes** (`_code_cased_tokens`: upper-case 2–5 letters, or the whole side); this is the rule the #705/#788 stopword lists were approximating (DAY: 1 upper / 217 lower), so the list is frozen. It also gives 4–5 letter codes (`CCSU`, `UAPB`) abbreviation equality, which `_is_short_code` (≤3) never did. Measured on the 2026-09-12 support bundle: 7/7 `team2_not_found` rows and both ALL-CAPS pipe feeds match; 45 hand corrections of that shape become unnecessary. Known gap kept out of scope (bead `8t9x.3`): a bare short name that is a strict prefix of another short name (`Indiana` vs Indiana State) still scores 1.00, as it did before.
- Video-quality tags (`[1080p]`, `720p`, `(4K)`, `FHD`) are stripped from the whole stream name in `normalize_stream` before prefix handling and again at the ends of each team name in `_clean_team_name`; `_discriminating` ignores resolution tokens so a stray one can never veto (#651 — one tagged source matched 0/30, its untagged twin 21/30).
- `residual_contradicts` is the fallback for unresolvable names — generalizes `_short_name_leg_is_safe` (#569) to the full-name leg, ignoring non-discriminating residuals (club suffixes, ≤2-char noise) so "us seattle sounders a" still reaches the Sounders.
- Measured in `tests/matching/test_fixture_corpus.py`: **0 false vetoes / 200**, **322/322 crosstalk rejected**. Regenerate the corpus with `tests/matching/corpus/build_corpus.py`.
- **Tennis gate (#283, `tennis_matcher.py`)** — same veto-only shape, no alias table: a stream that names a pooled tournament (distinctive ESPN name tokens; generic open/cup/masters ignored) vetoes candidates from other tournaments → `FailedReason.TENNIS_TOURNAMENT_MISMATCH`; a stream naming none defers. Keyed on `Event.tournament_id` (season-stable ESPN id, threaded through both caches). Draw shape is validated per side: doubles pairs (`abbreviation` "A/B") match exact-only because `token_set_ratio("sinner", "Sinner/Sonego")` = 100, and a side written as a pair (`/`, `&`) never matches a singles player; `_` defers. Tournament tier selection beyond majors/all and include/exclude lists were deliberately rejected (maintenance).
- **Per-court feeds (#689, US Open 2026 live data).** ESPN+ carries a slam as one stream per court with nothing else in the name (`ESPN+ 17: Arthur Ashe Stadium @ Sep 01 11:30AM ET`); TSN+ as `US Open: Day #1 - Court 7 (ft. …)` (and `Louis Armstong Stadium`, sic). Three stacked causes, all fixed: (1) `_COURT_PATTERNS` knew only Wimbledon shapes — named show courts (`ashe`/`armstrong`/`grandstand`) and `Stadium N` → `N` added, keys shared with ESPN's `venue.court`; (2) mixed groups never reached the tennis path — `_try_mixed_group_fallbacks` (racing, then tennis) runs after a failed primary route when the group has a tennis league and the text names a **court** (never a round: "final" is everywhere), then `match_feed` still has to join that court on the day's slate; the EPG path gates on `names_tournament` and `match_program` still demands pair-or-court; (3) the normalizer's reversed `DD @ Mon` pattern ate `Court 12 @ Sep 01` as Sep 12 — it now yields when the month is followed by its own day number. Also fixed: `_named_tournaments` reduced "US Open" to the lone token `us`, so every `US:`-prefixed stream vetoed all other tournaments — distinctive tokens are ≥3 chars, or the full name as a phrase.

**EPG Program Matching** (epic `teamarr-183`, `teamarr/consumers/matching/epg_*.py`):
- Matches static-named linear channels (ESPN, FS1) to events via Dispatcharr's program guide (`GET /api/epg/programs/search/`, feature-detected, Dispatcharr 0.24.0+), then time-shares one stream across many event channels (attach/detach window per program).
- Opt-in: per-group `epg_match_enabled` only (no global switch as of eqz/3lp1 — EPG matching is always available; each event-group opts in). Global tuning (attach/detach buffers, `epg_stream_pre/post_buffer_minutes`, default 60) lives on the **Matching** page (`/matching`, `EpgMatchingSettings` component) as of the v2.7.0 IA overhaul — not Settings. Per-group flag also sets `skip_builtin` so static names survive filtering.
- Channel-source mode (183.9, `epg_channel_source_enabled`): additive source from streams curated onto Dispatcharr channels (each channel's own EPG), run as a hidden system group (`is_channel_source`, `ensure_channel_source_group`); excludes Teamarr's own channels and dedupes streams already in EPG-match M3U groups. Candidate builder: `_fetch_channel_source_streams`.
- `epg_resolver.py` bridges the stream `tvg_id` → program `tvg_id` namespace gap via a cascade: direct tvg_id → curated channel `epg_data_id` → strict name match (does NOT require an EPG-linked channel). `_Teamarr` source excluded.
- **Resolution inputs are run-scoped, not per-group (#734).** `_build_epg_index` runs once per event group, but the EPGData catalog, the stream→channel maps, the active-source set and the derived `EpgCatalogIndex` depend on the Dispatcharr install alone. `StreamMatching._epg_resolution_inputs` fetches and indexes them once and `process_all_groups` clears the memo alongside `_shared_events`. Keep it that way: `/api/epg/epgdata/` ignores `page_size` and answers with every row in one response (50k+ on a real install ≈ 1.5s), and rebuilding the catalog index costs ~220ms — per group, both of them, before #734. A failed fetch is deliberately NOT cached, so one blip can't disable EPG matching for the rest of the run.
- `epg_index.py` fetches by resolved tvg_id, keys by stream tvg_id; `epg_matcher.py` routes program title+sub_title (pipe-joined) through `classify_stream → TeamMatcher`.
- `MatchMethod.EPG` persisted to `managed_channel_streams.match_method` → drives the `epg_match` stream-ordering rule. EPG-matched groups show an "EPG Matched" badge.
- Tennis programmes (mf7.9, #642): `TennisMatcher.match_program` — binds only with a tournament clue AND (player pair OR court) from title|sub_title|description; pair → one match, court → that court's matches inside the programme slot; otherwise `FailedReason.TENNIS_MATCHUP_UNKNOWN`, surfaced on the linear stream's result via `_epg_tennis_unknown` in `_reconcile_epg`. Never a tournament-wide fan-out (the 2026-07-05 regression).
- Docs: `docs/guide/matching/program-matching.md`.

**Race feeds (#245, `teamarr/database/race_feeds.py`)** — per-driver onboard / pit-lane / tracker / timing channels for F1 ride the **existing exception-keyword engine**, not team subscriptions and not a new channel key: a feed row is a keyword scoped to one league (`race_feeds` table: `league`, stable `feed_key`, `kind` driver|variant, `label`, `match_terms`, `behavior`, `enabled`, `managed`), and `Sub-Consolidate` already yields one channel per event **and per session** keyed on the label (`find_existing_channel` on `(event_id-segment, exception_keyword, feed_team_id)`), with `{exception_keyword}` naming and the EPG annotation for free. `get_keywords_for_league(conn, league, globals)` puts the league's feeds **ahead of** the global keywords; all three keyword check sites (`lifecycle/creator.py` via `service._check_exception_keyword(..., league)`, `enforcement/keywords.py`, `event_group_processor/xmltv.py`) go through it — a new check site must too, or a driver surname leaks into other sports. Default behavior is **Ignore** so nothing reaches a channel until the user picks it. The roster is harvested by `ESPNProvider.get_race_roster` (`TournamentParserMixin`, `ROSTER_LEAGUES = {f1}`) from the season's **last completed** race — ESPN lists zero competitors on a scheduled race — via one `dates=YYYY0101-YYYY1231` scoreboard call (22 drivers, names + country flag, no ids); codes are first-3-of-surname with an FIA override map. `CacheRefresher.refresh_race_feeds` runs with every cache refresh and on `POST /api/v1/race-feeds/refresh`; `upsert_roster` rewrites label/terms on managed rows and never touches behavior/enabled. Captured provider shapes (2026-09-12, prod Dispatcharr scan) are pinned in `tests/test_race_feeds.py`; bare `DATA` is deliberately not a term. **GP-less shapes (bead `hjzo.7`):** Apple TV (`Formula 1: Spain: Qualifying - Charles Leclerc`) and F1 TV (`[4K] Ferrari: Charles Leclerc @ 13 Sep 09:00 AM`, `F1 LIVE @ …`) carry no Grand Prix name. `RacingMatcher` now takes `db_factory` and, when exactly ONE event covers the date, accepts a race-feed hit (`_names_a_race_feed`, any behavior — an Ignore row is still evidence) or a series word plus a timestamp inside a session window (`_stream_instant_covered`, the EPG anchor gate) in place of the sanity score; never a selector — two covering events defer to name scores. Sessions: `_session_category_from_stream_name` strips trailing metadata (`strip_stream_metadata`: `@ 12 Sep …`, `(2026-…)`, `[1080p]`, `(English)`) before the label scan and then looks for practice/qualifying/sprint words **anywhere** (`Practice #3` included; bare `race` deliberately not — "Pre-Race Show"); with no session word, `expand_racing_segments` binds to the session nearest the stream's own timestamp (`stream_date/time/tz` carried on the matched dict from the classifier, group `stream_timezone` fallback) instead of fanning out. Pinned in `tests/matching/test_racing_session_binding.py`. Known pre-existing gap (bead filed): a cycling `Grand Prix Cycliste de Montreal` stream in an F1 group clears the single-event sanity score (52.6 ≥ 50) on the words "grand prix" alone.

**Failure taxonomy** (`epg_failed_matches.reason`, #661/#662/#683): a real `FailedReason` value, or a prefixed verdict — `filtered:<FilteredReason>` (not_event, league_not_included, regex, stale) and `skipped:<exclusion>` (unclassifiable linear names, name_match_disabled, team_streams_disabled). Bare `"unmatched"` is the unreachable last resort. EPG-path misses (#683): a linear stream whose guide programmes were attempted but bound nothing gets `no_epg_program_match` with a programme summary in `detail` (counts + sample titles, recorded per tvg_id in `_compute_epg_plan`, applied in `_reconcile_epg`); tennis-unknown sets `tennis_matchup_unknown` as a real reason now (the old exclusion_reason overwrite persisted as bare unmatched). A specific name-path verdict is never overridden. `candidates_gated` = every candidate was skipped before scoring (search window / EPG anchor / sport hint); `no_event_found` = candidates were scored and none cleared the floor. Two #791 refinements: `event_beyond_window` = the stream's own trusted date sits past `event_match_days_ahead` (no candidate can exist yet; fires after `date_mismatch`, which stays the verdict when candidates were actually date-gated), and `fixture_league_not_subscribed` = the sides DO share leagues but all are outside the subscription (TeamMatcher needs `include_leagues` for it — threaded from StreamMatcher). Neither is in `_CACHEABLE_FAILED_REASONS`: both flip the moment the window advances or the user subscribes. `detail` carries the near-miss summary over *scored* candidates only; `exclusion_reason` rides alongside. Frontend labels: `RunHistoryTable.tsx::getFailedReasonLabel`.

## Plans & Roadmap

Feature planning lives in beads: `bd list --label roadmap`

Legacy plans in `plans/` (gitignored) may have additional context.

## Code Health Audit

**On-demand, not scheduled.** Run with: `audit`

The cyclical epic (`teamarr-5hq`) was **retired 2026-08-23** — the quarterly cadence collapsed after Apr 2026 and its function migrated to continuous `# TODO: PRUNE/REFACTOR` markers during normal work plus on-demand `/code-review` and `/simplify`. Do NOT create recurring audit beads. File findings as their own beads.

When the user says **"audit"**, run the full sweep:

1. **Dead API endpoints** — cross-reference every route in `teamarr/api/routes/` against the ENTIRE `frontend/src/` directory (not just `api/` — the frontend uses both structured api clients AND direct `fetch()` calls in pages/components) and backend callers. Only flag as dead if zero hits across all search patterns.
2. **Dead frontend code** — find unused exports in `frontend/src/api/`, `frontend/src/hooks/`, `frontend/src/components/`. Check for dynamic imports and lazy loading in `App.tsx` before flagging components as dead.
3. **Layer separation** — routes should only do request/response; no direct DB queries (`conn.execute`, `cursor`) in routes. Business logic belongs in services/consumers.
4. **Code quality** — god functions (200+ lines), deep nesting (4+ levels), inconsistent logging, magic numbers.
5. **Frontend hygiene** — unused components, dead hooks, stale API client functions.

6. **Test coverage before pruning** — before removing ANY code marked for pruning, verify:
   - Run `pytest tests/ -v` to confirm all existing tests pass first.
   - Search for callers/importers one more time (grep the entire codebase, not just obvious locations).
   - Check git blame — if code was added recently, it may be WIP or needed for an upcoming feature. Ask the user before removing.
   - After pruning, run `pytest tests/ -v` again and `cd frontend && npm run build` to confirm nothing broke.
   - If removing an API endpoint, also check for external consumers (Dispatcharr callbacks, webhook URLs, cron jobs calling the API).
   - **Never prune comments that explain WHY something works a certain way** — only remove commented-out dead code.
   - When in doubt, leave it and mark with `# TODO: PRUNE? — verify with user` instead of removing.

**Evaluation principles (apply these when deciding if code is dead or pruneable):**
- **"Zero callers" is necessary but not sufficient.** Also ask: does removing it lose any capability? If another endpoint/function covers the same functionality, it's safe. If it's the only way to do something, be cautious even if nothing calls it today.
- **Duplicate endpoints:** When GET and POST versions exist doing the same thing, the POST (superset — accepts optional body) is the keeper. The GET adds no unique capability.
- **Consider external consumers** that won't show up in code search: browser bookmarks, monitoring scripts, curl commands, Dispatcharr callbacks, Docker healthchecks, cron jobs. GET endpoints are especially exposed since they're URL-accessible.
- **Frontend has two calling patterns:** structured api clients (`frontend/src/api/*.ts`) and direct `fetch()` calls in pages/components. Always search the ENTIRE `frontend/src/` for URL path strings.
- **Never trust automated dead-code detection without manual verification.** The Q1 2026 audit had a high false-positive rate because agents only searched api client files, missing direct `fetch()` calls.
- **"Is it called?" is the wrong question. "Would we lose capability?" is the right one.**

**Ongoing responsibilities (during normal development):**
- When you encounter dead code while working on features/bugs, mark it with `# TODO: PRUNE — <reason>` immediately.
- When you notice layer violations or code smell, add `# TODO: REFACTOR — <reason>`.
- These TODO markers are the standing backlog — they get cleaned up at the next `audit` run, whenever the user calls one.
- After each audit, update these evaluation principles with any new lessons learned.

**Prior audit history (14 passes, Feb–Apr 2026):** `bd show teamarr-5hq`

## Sync Status

When asked to **"sync status"** or **"update status"**:

**Principle: one source of truth per fact.** GitHub owns issue/PR state (via labels), beads own work state, `plans/STATUS.md` owns only judgment (priorities, next steps, standing facts). Never transcribe into STATUS.md anything that `gh`/`bd` can derive live.

**Label vocabulary** (issue state lives HERE, not in prose — triagers maintain these too). Status labels track the work lifecycle; `type:` labels classify the change; two special labels flag ownership/blockers:
| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `status: needs-triage` | No assessment or bead yet |
| `status: needs-bead` | Triaged; needs a bead before work |
| `status: ready` | Bead created; queued for work |
| `status: on-dev` | Landed on dev; closes at next release. `gh issue list --label "status: on-dev"` = release checklist |
| `status: released` | Shipped in a release |
| `contributor-led` | Community contributor driving implementation |
| `research` | Blocked on research / data-source discovery |
| `type: process` | Standing process/housekeeping issue (also `type:` bug/feature/enhancement/docs/chore/refactor/league) |

**The sync:**
1. Query live state: `gh issue list --state open`, `gh pr list`, `bd list -n 300` (beware default 50-row cap), read comment threads on anything that changed
2. Reconcile labels — new untriaged issues get `status: needs-triage`; dev-landed fixes get `status: on-dev`; fix wrong/missing labels
3. Cross-reference issues ↔ beads; file beads for triaged issues that lack them (`(#NNN)` in bead title)
4. **Rewrite `plans/STATUS.md` from scratch** (target ≤80 lines): header (version, dev-ahead count, release-trigger check, open counts), Needs Attention (≤10 curated rows of judgment), Next Work queue, Standing Facts, last 3 changelog entries. Never append-and-patch — full regeneration makes drift impossible. Prior history lives in `plans/archive/`.
5. Present summary; state whether a release trigger is met

## Adding a New League

Add to `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO leagues` in `teamarr/database/schema.sql`. Restart to apply.

## Database Schema Changes

**Adding a new column:** Just add it to the `CREATE TABLE` in `schema.sql`. Schema reconciliation (`teamarr/database/reconciliation.py`) automatically detects and adds missing columns on startup by comparing the real database against an in-memory reference built from `schema.sql`. No migration block needed.

**Data migration (transforming existing data):** Add a versioned `if current_version < N:` block in `_run_migrations()` in `database/migrations/versioned.py`. Bump the `schema_version DEFAULT` in `schema.sql`. Column additions in mixed blocks should use `_add_column_if_not_exists` as a safety net for tests that call `_run_migrations` directly.

**Table rebuild (CHECK constraint changes):** Add a pre-migration function in `init_db()` that backs up the table, drops it, and lets `executescript` recreate it. Add a restore block in `_run_migrations` keyed on the backup table's existence. See `_migrate_settings_for_v65` as the pattern.

**Startup order:** `init_db` → verify integrity → structural pre-migrations → reconcile schema → executescript → data migrations → seed cache.

## Common Commands

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 app.py                    # Run on port 9195
pytest tests/ -v                  # Run tests
ruff check teamarr/ tests/        # Lint
ruff format teamarr/              # Format
cd frontend && npm run build      # Build frontend
```

## Logging

**Configuration:** `teamarr/utilities/logging.py`

**Log directory detection** (in priority order):
1. `LOG_DIR` env var (if set)
2. `/app/data/logs` (if `/app/data` exists - Docker or host with `/app`)
3. `<project_root>/logs` (local dev fallback)

**IMPORTANT:** On this dev machine, `/app/data/` exists at the system level, so both Docker AND local dev write to `/app/data/logs/` (not `./data/logs/`).

**Log files:**
| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `teamarr.log` | Main log (rotating 10MB x 5) |
| `teamarr_errors.log` | Errors only (rotating 10MB x 3) |

**View recent logs:**
```bash
tail -n 100 /app/data/logs/teamarr.log      # On this dev machine
tail -n 100 ./data/logs/teamarr.log         # Standard Docker setup
docker logs --tail 100 teamarr              # Docker container stdout
```

**Environment variables** (set in docker-compose.yml):
- `LOG_LEVEL`: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR (default: INFO for console, DEBUG for files)
- `LOG_FORMAT`: "text" or "json" (default: text)
- `LOG_DIR`: Override log directory path

**Note:** `./data/logs/` in the project directory contains stale V1 logs from Dec 2025 - these can be deleted.

## MCP Servers

**Playwright** (`@playwright/mcp`) - Browser automation for testing UI, capturing screenshots, verifying frontend changes. Tools available:
- `browser_navigate` - Navigate to URL
- `browser_click` - Click elements
- `browser_type` - Enter text in fields
- `browser_snapshot` - Get accessibility tree (preferred over screenshots)
- `browser_screenshot` - Capture page screenshot

Use for: Visual verification of UI changes, testing frontend flows, debugging styling issues.
<!-- BEGIN BEADS INTEGRATION v:1 profile:minimal hash:7510c1e2 -->
## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY (code AND beads):
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   bd dolt push  # beads live in refs/dolt/data, not in the commits
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
