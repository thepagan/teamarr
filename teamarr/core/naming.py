"""Naming heuristics for Gracenote-convention prose (epic tvnk, #329).

Gracenote's definite-article rule (confirmed in captured data, see
plans/gracenote-reference.md): club/franchise teams take "the" ("The
Washington Mystics play the New York Liberty…"); national teams do not
("Germany take on Curaçao…"). Individual-sport competitors (tennis players,
fighters, drivers) never take an article.

Tournaments follow ordinary English: "the US Open" / "the French Open" but
"Wimbledon" / "Roland Garros". Ordinary-noun tournament names (Open,
Championships, Cup, …) take the article; bare proper names do not.

The national-team signal is league-based: Teamarr's Team model carries no
club/national flag, and discovered soccer leagues never touch the schema
table, so a slug heuristic over ESPN league codes is the practical signal
(kept conservative and extensible).
