"""Team identity resolution over the global team cache (epic goax).

The matcher's oldest structural weakness is that it compares *strings*. It asks
"does this stream side look like the home team?" and "does that side look like
the away team?", accepts when the weaker leg clears a floor, and never asks the
question a human would ask first: **do these two teams actually play each
other?**

Because `token_set_ratio` weighs every token equally, a shared *city* — the
least informative half of a team name — is enough on its own:

    Tampa Bay Lightning / Tampa Bay Rays        = 78.3
    Detroit Red Wings   / Detroit Tigers        = 71.0
    Northern Colorado   / Colorado Rockies      = 66.7
    Eastern Washington  / Washington Nationals  = 73.7

all above BOTH_TEAMS_THRESHOLD (60), so an NHL stream lands on an MLB channel.
This is not a handful of bad pairs: among the six major North American pro
leagues alone there are 161 cross-league team pairs scoring >= 60, and
"New York Mets" / "New York Jets" reaches 92.3 — above even
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD.

The fix is to resolve each side to the real *teams* that bear that name, using
`team_cache` (~10.8k teams across ~327 leagues and 14 sports, already populated
on every install). A side that resolves only to NHL teams cannot fill a slot in
an MLB fixture, whatever its string score.

Two properties of this index are load-bearing, both measured on real data:

1. **Ties are kept, never collapsed.** `SF Giants` and `NY Giants` produce the
   *same* four-way tie at 80.0 (San Francisco Giants, New York Giants, Keystone
   Giants, Wabash Little Giants). Collapsing to argmax would invent a wrong
   answer half the time. Keeping the tie is correct: the caller only needs the
   set of *leagues* those identities span, and both Giants resolve to leagues
   that include the one being matched.

2. **It vetoes, it never selects.** Resolution is a strong negative signal and a
   weak positive one — `D-backs` resolves to "ACL D-backs" (a rookie-league
   team), not Arizona. So the verdict below can say CONTRADICTED, and otherwise
   defers to the existing scoring ladder. Nothing here can create a match that
   scoring would not already have made; it can only withhold one.

Note what is deliberately *absent*: a schedule lookup. Verifying "is there a
game between these teams at this date/time" needs no new API call, because the
matcher is only ever handed real events drawn from real schedules — the
candidate event's own existence is that evidence. Identity is the only missing
half.
