"""Unified stream matcher - the main entry point for stream matching.

Replaces CachedMatcher and MultiLeagueMatcher with a cleaner architecture:
1. Classify streams (placeholder, team_vs_team, event_card)
2. Route to appropriate matcher
3. Track results with MatchOutcome system
4. Handle caching with method tracking

Usage:
    from teamarr.consumers.matching import StreamMatcher

    matcher = StreamMatcher(
        service=sports_data_service,
        db_factory=get_db,
        group_id=1,
        search_leagues=["nfl", "nba"],
    )
