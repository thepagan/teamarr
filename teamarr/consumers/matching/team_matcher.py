# EPG anchored matching (bead t5e). A live broadcast's EPG program starts at ~the
# event's official start; encores/replays/"classic" re-airs and the next game in a

# candidate event must fall within this tolerance of it to match — the definitive,
# category-independent guard against binding a stream to an encore or the wrong

#
# 90 minutes (chosen 2026-06-03): a team-sport event always runs >90 min, so the
# earliest an encore can START is >90 min after the live start — outside the gate.

# lead-in). Tighter than an hours-wide window on purpose: it also excludes the
# OTHER game of a same-day doubleheader (hours apart). Trade-off: if a provider's
# guide lists the live program >90 min off the event start, that event simply gets
