"""Typed contracts for the generation pipeline (#830, Packet 2).

Internal only. These types make the orchestration in ``generation.py``
explicit so it can be split into ordered stages without the phases
communicating through closure variables. They are deliberately **not** the
plugin ABI: a plugin boundary uses serialized records, not these classes.

Every type here is either moved verbatim from ``generation.py`` (``GenerationResult``,
``GenerationCancelled``) or additive. ``generation.py`` re-exports the moved
ones, so existing imports and monkeypatch paths keep working.
