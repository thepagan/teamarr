    Uses smart boundary matching to avoid false positives like "Eli" matching

    and multi-word phrases like "Peyton and Eli".

    A term never fires on a word the matched event is itself named with
    (#803): the seeded "Spanish" keyword, set to Ignore, dropped every
    "Spanish Grand Prix" stream on a live install. Pass the event's identity
    text (:func:`event_identity_text`) and any term found inside it is
    skipped for that stream — "Spanish" for the Spanish GP, "French" for the
    French Open — while "En Español" / "(ESP)" still fire, since the event
    is not named with them.

    An EPG-matched linear stream (#829) is named for its network ("ESPN 2"),
    so the feed evidence lives in the guide programme instead: "Monday Night
    Football with Peyton and Eli | Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs".
    ``program_title`` is that matched programme's title|sub_title and is
    searched after the stream name — the stream's own name is the more
    direct evidence, so a keyword it names wins over one only the guide
    names. The event-name guard applies to both.
