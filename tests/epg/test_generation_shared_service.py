"""One run-scoped ``SportsDataService`` per generation (#830, Packet 1).

``run_full_generation`` has always claimed to build a single service and share
it "across all processing" so the event cache stays warm for the whole run.
Group processing and lifecycle construction did receive it; team processing did
not — ``process_all_teams()`` took no ``service`` argument and so built its own
with a cold cache. These tests make the claim true and keep it true.

The observable consequence is fewer provider calls, because the second consumer
to ask for an event now finds it cached. That is the intended change; what must
*not* change is the provider-call metric schema, its endpoint/provider
attribution, the reset-at-run-start timing, or its persistence onto the run row
(all pinned in ``test_generation_contract.py``).
