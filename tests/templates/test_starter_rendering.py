"""Starter-set rendering against Gracenote conventions (tvnk.9, #329).

Renders every starter template's text surfaces through the REAL resolver
(variable extraction, condition selection, cleanup/capitalization) with
family-appropriate contexts, and asserts CONVENTION parity — grammar,
articles, separators, field register — never verbatim Gracenote text
(maintainer acceptance framing on epic tvnk: Gracenote editorial isn't
licensable and isn't the goal).

Conventions under test (docs/reference/gracenote-categories.md):
- club/franchise teams take "the", national teams and soccer clubs don't
- college register is home-led host framing with rank + record
- soccer register is "X face Y", channel connector 'v'
- tournament titles are year-composed ("FIFA World Cup 2026")
- MiLB titles as "Minor League Baseball" (via the seeded category)
