"""Failure records say why (#662).

38% of one install's persisted "failures" carried the literal string
"unmatched" — not a FailedReason, just persistence's catch-all for anything
that was neither matched nor an exception. Those rows were filter verdicts and
per-source skips, not match failures. And `no_event_found` absorbed candidates
that were never scored at all (outside the search window, past the EPG anchor,
sport-hint mismatch), while the near-miss summary printed 100/100 for one of
them — sending triage after the fixture gate for a window miss.
