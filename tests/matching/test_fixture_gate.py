"""Cross-sport false positives: the fixture gate end to end (epic goax).

Reproduces the Discord report of 2026-08-24. An "ESPN + 2" source scoped to MLB
created channel "MLB | TB/DET" for event 401816657 and then attached
`ESPN+ 81 (D): Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Detroit Red Wings` to it, because the
shared cities alone score above the accept floor:

    Tampa Bay Lightning / Tampa Bay Rays = 78.3
    Detroit Red Wings   / Detroit Tigers = 71.0   -> min() = 71.0 >= 60

Nothing downstream could catch it: `classify_stream` returns no sport hint and no
league hint for these names, and they carry no date, so neither the sport gate
nor the trusted-date gate fires.

These tests drive the real `TeamMatcher` against a real `team_cache`, because
the gate is inert without one — a matcher built with `db_factory=None` has no
identity index and behaves exactly as it did before.
