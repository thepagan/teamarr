# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Broadcaster parsing (#752)
#
# HockeyTech sends `broadcasters` as a home/away/national mapping when a game
# has any, and as an empty LIST when it has none. `_parse_broadcasts` defaulted
# it to {} and called .get() on it, so the list shape raised AttributeError —
# which reached `_parse_event`'s handler and dropped the ENTIRE GAME. A fixture
# with no listed broadcaster never became an Event, so no stream could match it:
# 17 distinct games a day on one production install, re-dropped every run.
#
# The load-bearing assertion is not that broadcasts parse — it is that the
# EVENT survives a broadcaster field of any shape.
