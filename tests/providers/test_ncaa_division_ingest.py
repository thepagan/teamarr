"""Per-league NCAA division opt-out (#811).

ESPN files a game under a division when EITHER side belongs to it, so a
division a user drops costs only the fixtures played entirely inside it —
measured over four 2026 slates, none of the 345 events unique to college
football's group 35 involved a Division I team. The contract under test:
a dropped division is never REQUESTED, everything else keeps the full slate,
and every way the setting can be absent or wrong lands on the full slate too.
